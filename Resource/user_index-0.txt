1	If youve only ever used Internet Explorer  you dont know what youre missing  Firefox makes Web browsing easier  more secure  and ultimately more enjoyable	Single handedly changed the way I use webmail  I dont think I could live without it now  Seriously	love it! i use this for email everyday!	More space and better features than its competitors and  at the moment  the only Webmail service you can access offline  I wouldnt use anything else		2	the first web service i ever used & despite the invasive ads theres something i like about yahoo  cant quite put my finger on it but yeah yahoo!	Got a busier interface than Multiply or Xanga & less intuitive than either of those other two apps  BUT now Ive been using it a bit finding it best of the 3
