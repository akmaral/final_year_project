1	More useful than I thought it would be  Its not digital crack for me like it is for others  but its certainly changed interactions with my social circle	Ive settled on it as my preferred Twitter client  Works great; my biggest gripe is that its built on AIR  and tends to be resource heavy  Great featureset tho	Convenience is king  Ive bought more games through Steam than Ive ever bought in a store  and the weekly sales are a huge plus	Interesting idea  A definite good first offering  though I think itll need to mature a bit before it can be a serious contender	Mostly useless  but when its useful  its really useful  Collaborative design seems to be its niche	High octane geek oriented social news filtering  No nonsense UI  great amounts of content  and more customizable than competing offerings  Love it	Im a recent convert  and Ive been really happy with it  I used to just listen to Shoutcast radio  Last fm is that  except better in all the right ways	Hard to beat  IEs a relic of a bygone age by now  but Opera  Safari  and Chrome dont match its customizability via plugins  Im a definite fan	Im a big fan  Didnt see what the fuss was about  but once I started using it I was hooked  Love being immersed in the daily buzz	A bit of a memory hog at times  but its good enough that I use it as my primary  Does just about everything I want in an email client  and not much else	Really great combination of several products  Has some stability and performance problems preventing love it from me  but those will hopefully get worked out	Great featureset  but feels relatively unpolished and eats up a ton of RAM  I still use it for the time being  but Im shopping for a replacement	Great extension  Im really  really digging the multiple rows of tabs  since I tend to have something like 30 open at any given time	1st Jabber client I used  and good enough at what it does  but I dont have a use for it over other multi protocol IM clients  Good app  but not for me anymore	This + my XBox 360 completely satisfies my TV entertainment needs  Dont have cable anymore  and dont miss it	I use WinSCP as my general purpose FTP/SCP client now  but before that  FileZilla was my choice  Great if you just need FTP	Everything I want from a torrent client  and nothing I dont  Not much to say beyond that!	Not bad  but AIR apps have a tendency to jack up my system  Its a solid app  but Ive dropped it in favor of Digsby  since Im already using it for IM		
10667	This is one of the best think on the online solution	much more people use this searchbox		
76495	Great Twitter client app  with tons of functionality   Anything you need to do on Twitter   The only way to go if you have an iPhone		
29276	i think dat itz awesome		
2	I dont add videos  but I sure do enjoy watching them	Freaking sweet search visualization  The search could still get better  but overall  this shows a lot of promise  Especially for a movie geek like myself	A great spot for local information  even if a little distracting from the core focus at times	IE trembles in its wake  As it should	A quality service with just the right plug in for my favorite blogging platform  Tumblr	Nice  but with room for improvement  Given its immediate scale  however  I think people will find this a compelling complement to their social media addictions	Simply the best  Now if Google only made a desktop client that beat Outlook	Absolutely killer  You cant beat its simplicity  or its most wonderful freeness	Intuitive for even the analytically challenged	What was life like before Google? Less informed  less simple	A nice application for the friend collectors of the world	If you want the most robust blogging platform  this is it  I prefer Tumblr for simplicitys sake  but I think Wordpress is incredible	I havent gone there but a few times  but I cant do anything but give the design a solid love it!	Its a great idea  and good execution  If only it worked all the time	Okay  so Im biased  But truly  I do love blippr  first as a user  then as a founder  I know we have much more to do  but I like where were heading	Movie nerd that I am  I love it  It could use a UI update  but the content is fantastic	I dont use it for my regular news  but I do use it as a way to find *some* entertainment news  And typically its good	The easiest blogging app around  inclusive of some killer aesthetic features and layout options  Bravo	A very useful FF plug in for the tweeting inclined	It gets the job done  but it isnt nearly as good as Picasa  Flickr  or other services I prefer	A wonderful video site that is a far superior user experience than YouTube  And their commercials rock  too	I dont use it all the time  but its a really nice app when I do	A great idea  wonderfully executed by an exceptional team	For what it does  it does well  (Side note: this is my first iPhone blip!)	Its beautiful  plain and simple	Google has crushed me yet again with their Tsunami of Awesomeness!	Discovery made simple  O the things Ive stumbled upon since!	The next big thing? Im not sure  but it does a good job fulfilling its purpose	A dead simple app with the perfect features  A must buy for all iPhone using  Twitter loving geeks	Fast  I havent made the switch from FF3 quite yet  but it may someday come  Only time will tell	The anti YouTube if you will  Vimeo is a wonderful example of creativity on the web	The most useful guide to navigate the Social Media landscape  period  (Full disclosure: theyre our parents  so Im biased )	Simple and effective  And the provider of vlips (video blips)  too!	Inspiration for blippr  What more need I say?		
3	By far the most user friendly and flexible email service I have found   Far better than MSN/Yahoo/Any other free email service	Cmon you dont need me to say anything about Firefox   Use it  Love it  abandon Internet Explorer for all things except updates		
96095	Mega useful when sharing full res photos and videos with mates and you dont want to use Flickr or Facebook		
4	Great way to get news fast	Check it almost everyday and I love how easy it is to find people you havent connected with in years	Great way to stay in touch with friends throughout the day	Personally I dont use YouTube to post videos  but I love watching what other people have posted on there	I can listen to songs that I havent heard in a long time  NO COMMERCIALS either!	I really like the fact that Gmail doesnt erase your emails after so many days and youre able to look up past IM conversations  Even better  its FREE!		
35940	The best just after Firefox !	The best social website !		
5	Anyone who is still using Internet Explorer needs to be educated	Like all the useful things Ive come across  Steam was introduced to me by my brother  Useful for hopelessly addicted TF2 gamers	The best  most recently accurate source of information on the planet  It should totally be a legitimate source on scholarly research =P	So freaking cool! Download a copy and go explore your planet  Be sure to check out the topography  too  Mount Everest is really hard to find  though	Good to find out about movies you like  but not a very user friendly interface  Id like it more if the layout was more shiney	Fantastic site  just what every creative mind that uses computer programs needs  My one complaint is that I dont have my own software to record something!		
6	Its fun and I trust my friends opinions more than reviewers

34601	Its my primary blogging platform	Love it  Best place for all my social media news  Its all I need!		
10634	does everything one could need  Only downside is its use of XHTML which is inappropriate for the vast majority of Web users out there (the ones using IE)	Thoroughly enjoyable  but can easily eat away the hours of your day if you give in to it		
60932	I love it I stay on it the whole time Im online  You dont have to use the web and have a tab open to keep up with Tweets	I have been using Internet Explorer since 1998 and for some reason I downloaded Firefox I am moving all my bookmarks to Firefox its so much better and faster		
81875	I could honestly say that facebook is a perfectly good networking creation  it has many features of you being able to occupy time  and meet and greet everyone!
