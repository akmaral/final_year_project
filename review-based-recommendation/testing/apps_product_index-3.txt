336679	If youve only ever used Internet Explorer  you dont know what youre missing  Firefox makes Web browsing easier  more secure  and ultimately more enjoyable	Hard to beat  IEs a relic of a bygone age by now  but Opera  Safari  and Chrome dont match its customizability via plugins  Im a definite fan	My weapon of choice in the browser wars  Safer and has a plug in for just about anything	By far my most used app  The custumization through extension is really great and has made this irriplaceable	IE trembles in its wake  As it should	Okay  so it IS better than IE   My loyal heart hates me  but switching was sooooo easy	Anyone who is still using Internet Explorer needs to be educated	IE sucks FF rocks :)	Best  Browser  Ever  Seriously  it does everything right  is wonderfully customizable  and is more stable and secure than IE	Does anyone even use that Other Browser anymore? I love the plugins  switching between tabs by keyboard shortcut  and I love that it saves my tabs when I exit!	A great project that shows what open source is capable of	Love the ability to customize it the way YOU want   IE is still trying to play catch up	its a toss up between firefox and safari for me	for some reason  browsers over time get more complex   although firefox has managed to stay lean  google chrome is winning me over	The only browser for me  its infinite customisability (Im making up words now!) means it still trumps Chrome/Safari etc	Little fox is not so little any more	powerful  love the add ons	It makes the browsing session extremely cool & exciting	Your opinion of this app in 160 characters or less	People who use IE are ignorant   Firefox renders the web better  period  Plus we get firebug :P	Revolucionou os navegadores e continua sendo o melhor	It has become a little bloated over the years  but as a developer and power user  nothing beats it (once you tweak it with add ons) DEATH TO MSIE!!!	How can you use the web and not love firefox?  No other browser comes close in my experience	Overall  its probably the best browser available  I love how easy it is to add extensions  And it works great on Linux!	Firefox is the best browser ever  Great add ons  its more secure than other browsers and so easy to use    i love firefox : )	Its my go to browser for web developement  With tools like FireBug  its a must have for javascript development	Superior to IE  Safari is still tops for Mac and I prefer Google Chrome for the PC  Firefox has fun Apps though	My favorite web browser  without a doubt  A bit over rated for its extensions  and not as fast as Opera  but I love it all the same	Cmon you dont need me to say anything about Firefox   Use it  Love it  abandon Internet Explorer for all things except updates	People love Safari  but Im a Mac user and I use Firefox 3 instead  What more is there to say?	I like the fresh perspective and the freedom it gives me  I do not like the time it takes to load though	Once I switched to FF  I never considered going back to IE for a second	really really I Love IT ! Its the most important     :D	the single most useful app ever  its secret? you can customise it to your hearts content & make it your own	The best Web browser ever made	Overall  it is very good  better than IE  but ties up too much memory  Has its share of issues with Vista  both 32 and 64 bit	My favorite browser by far   Love the tabs and the add ons as well	It really lives up to the hype  I cant imagine ever going back to IE  So many options so   awesome	I cant decide between Opera or Firefox yet  So far i like the Fox a bit better because of the various add ons	Web surfing bliss  Scads of add ons for nearly every purpose  Clean  organized and easy to use  Blows every other browser out of the water	Works ok for most of my needs  I can easily see myself using some other browser too	Not just a web browser! Its more than your imagination	Use it every day   Sure it has a few quirks  but hard to imagine life without it	I love it  its amazingly faster than IE and more organized  Tough competition with Chrome though IMO	Even though Ill try new & updated browsers  I always keep coming back to Firefox (currently using 3 1 beta 2)	Firefox add ons make it possible for a non techie like me to get a WHOLE lot more done than I normally could on my own	What other browser can handle 200+ open tabs? I couldnt get by without it	Not that good    too much overrated	Its few issues far outweigh its awesome ness!	Firefox continues to be the browser of choice!	I ditched it totally for Chrome	Great browser but be warned: there is a ton of plugins and add ons waiting to turn Firefox into a bloated memory hog! Choose wisely! :)	Great browser! But     I would say Safari beats it	A mastodon and heavy browser  but yes  there is the best and most complete	Best browser ever! The add ons create a really rich browsing experience	Sorry Firefox  I left you for Chrome   Your bushy tail is adorable  but the Simon Says logo was too good to resist	theres a few bugs  Id love it	my 1st string browser   crashes and is a mem hog at times tho	I use too many great plugins to even consider another browser	Keep trying other web browsers but I always end up coming back to Firefox  nothing can beat it	The best and quickest browser   plenty of extensions for customization!	Agreat browser with a lot of customization options  but just cant compare to Chrome in speed and its User Interface	my day doesnt start without it  leaves IE wanting	The plug ins are what make Firefox a great browser  I love that its the same interface on the Mac and PC	Based on my top 10 add ons preview   thats why i LOVE it	Bandwagonism maybe  but when something is this flexible and powerful  just gotta love it	Makes browsing fun	No doubts  the bestbrowser for its versatility!	Certainly better than IE (love lots of the plugins and its features) I prefer Google Chrome for its speed and simplicity	It may be a little slower than a couple of other browsers  but its major advantage is all the plug ins  The best out there and miles better than IE	My preferred browser for several years	Ive used firefox for years  but have recently started using Chrome	My favorite piece of software  period	The best web browser around	Who wouldnt want a highly extensible browser with a sane rendering engine? Its not a Microsoft product  either	Eats my resources and crashes like a weddingcrasher  Using it for webdev though	Best browser  Never fails and is massively customisable	The best browser Ive ever used	Best browser you can use without a doubt	Looks nice  mostly i like it because its fast and reliable	Started working with FF in 2008 and it was one of the best things I did in 2008	simply hate it    only thing that makes it usable is large amount of addons made for it :|	I love it its a 100 tomes better then internet explorer which will probably be obsolete very soon	Simply the best  All you could want in a web browser  and its on every conceivable OS	Best browser for my needs  The extensions are great  and the customizability is unmatched  Fairly secure  though it can be a bit of a resource hog after a while	Only browser Ill use	All the web into one single station  But its not as fast as it was before!	I was always a Internet Explorer user until I tried Firefox  Now Im never going back  Firefox is the best  I hope they get pre installed with computers someday	i love all the free add ons	Like Firefox but using Chrome 95% of the time now because its so much faster	Great  but has the downside of clogging up your system the longer you use it	FIrefoxs greatest feature is its extensions  I do wish it was a little snappier and used a little less resources	Fast  Customizable  Effective  Large User Base  Continual Development  etc  (In General Great   and MUCH faster than IE)	I LOVE Firefox!!  You can really personalize it to fit you!	Eats my pc resources  I passed at Chrome	I really like the lightweight feel  Dont miss IE for a second	Firefox is a really great browser  but the type of OS youre using makes a big difference   Safari is faster on Macs  Firefox is faster on Windows	First thing I install when I get a new computer!  An absolute must have   So customizable  I love it   Quit complaining if you have a mac  get a real computer	If you dont know it  you dont know the web !	I am a fan! Specially because of the great add ons	Takes too long to launch	I have yet to find a better browser  Simply amazing	Firefox is awesome but Safari CRUSHES it  :)	Firefox is a much better browse   Wish more people would use it	Its fantastic when its not hogging all my memory!
