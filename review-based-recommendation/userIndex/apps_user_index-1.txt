1	I use WinSCP as my general purpose FTP/SCP client now  but before that  FileZilla was my choice  Great if you just need FTP	Single handedly changed the way I use webmail  I dont think I could live without it now  Seriously	Everything I want from a torrent client  and nothing I dont  Not much to say beyond that!	Really great combination of several products  Has some stability and performance problems preventing love it from me  but those will hopefully get worked out	This + my XBox 360 completely satisfies my TV entertainment needs  Dont have cable anymore  and dont miss it	1st Jabber client I used  and good enough at what it does  but I dont have a use for it over other multi protocol IM clients  Good app  but not for me anymore	A bit of a memory hog at times  but its good enough that I use it as my primary  Does just about everything I want in an email client  and not much else	High octane geek oriented social news filtering  No nonsense UI  great amounts of content  and more customizable than competing offerings  Love it	Mostly useless  but when its useful  its really useful  Collaborative design seems to be its niche	Not bad  but AIR apps have a tendency to jack up my system  Its a solid app  but Ive dropped it in favor of Digsby  since Im already using it for IM	Great little plugin  The external player management is what I first used it for  but providing a inline flash player for any in page MP3s makes it a winner	Interesting idea  A definite good first offering  though I think itll need to mature a bit before it can be a serious contender	Im a big fan  Didnt see what the fuss was about  but once I started using it I was hooked  Love being immersed in the daily buzz	Great featureset  but feels relatively unpolished and eats up a ton of RAM  I still use it for the time being  but Im shopping for a replacement	Convenience is king  Ive bought more games through Steam than Ive ever bought in a store  and the weekly sales are a huge plus	Ill ashamedly admit to never really using finance software before Mint  but Mint made it easy and useful enough that I have no excuse not to	Im seriously impressed  I tried the RC on a whim  and have been very pleased in most every way	Great extension  Im really  really digging the multiple rows of tabs  since I tend to have something like 30 open at any given time

2	A nice application for the friend collectors of the world	I dont use it for my regular news  but I do use it as a way to find *some* entertainment news  And typically its good	A great idea  wonderfully executed by an exceptional team	If only I had more time in the day to enjoy this service to the fullest	What was life like before Google?

Im not sure  but it does a good job fulfilling its purpose	IE trembles in its wake  As it should	The easiest blogging app around  inclusive of some killer aesthetic features and layout options  Bravo	I love when I have it plugged in  But when I dont  I hate it saying I need to update  Argh!	I have a love/hate relationship with Facebook  I really do love the utility it provides  but hate that it demands so much of my time  Curse you  Zuckerberg!	I dont use it all the time  but its a really nice app when I do	Google has crushed me yet again with their Tsunami of Awesomeness!	Intuitive for even the analytically challenged	Nice  but with room for improvement  Given its immediate scale  however  I think people will find this a compelling complement to their social media addictions	I havent gone there but a few times  but I cant do anything but give the design a solid love it!	Simple and effective  And the provider of vlips (video blips)  too!	The mother that birthed a new web generation  Oh yeah  it has nice pictures  too	If you want the most robust blogging platform  this is it  I prefer Tumblr for simplicitys sake  but I think Wordpress is incredible	I dont add videos  but I sure do enjoy watching them	A great spot for local information  even if a little distracting from the core focus at times	The anti YouTube if you will  Vimeo is a wonderful example of creativity on the web	The most useful guide to navigate the Social Media landscape  period  (Full disclosure: theyre our parents  so Im biased )	For what it does  it does well  (Side note: this is my first iPhone blip!)	Its a great idea  and good execution  If only it worked all the time	A wonderful video site that is a far superior user experience than YouTube  And their commercials rock  too

Personally I dont use YouTube to post videos  but I love watching what other people have posted on there	I really like the fact that Gmail doesnt erase your emails after so many days and youre able to look up past IM conversations  Even better  its FREE!		
35940	The best social website !	The best search engine !		
5	Fantastic site  just what every creative mind that uses computer programs needs  My one complaint is that I dont have my own software to record something!	Anyone who is still using Internet Explorer needs to be educated	So freaking cool! Download a copy and go explore your planet  Be sure to check out the topography  too  Mount Everest is really hard to find  though	Heck Yeah  I love how the interface gets better every time I log on	The best  most recently accurate source of information on the planet  It should totally be a legitimate source on scholarly research =P	Good to find out about movies you like  but not a very user friendly interface  Id like it more if the layout was more shiney

87958	Im a google fan  have been for years  I like being able to have certain docs stored online for easy access for myself and others	Ive just started using twitter  Ive had for quite a while and didnt use much  until I began posting to plurk  Then plurk immediately posts to twitter	So far I like blippr  I only signed up this morning  but so far so good	Ive had gmail for years  and I love it  I like the way Contacts are set up  And is more customizable than anything else Ive used	I go through withdrawals if I miss a couple of days on Facebook  Just about all  if not most of my family and friends use it also  which makes it more enjoyable	I use it often  especially to look up band discographys  Very accurate		
35038	best source for movies online	best search engine	best browser at the moment	wouldnt use it without apps like tweetdeck	adobe needs to come up with more innovative features

49669	pretty cool   i geuss		
8545	Great  I even found a promo code on Daring Fireball (the promo code is DARINGFIREBALL)	I use it every day! (Pingle is a great iPhone Ping fm client)	For some reason I dont like it very much  I prefer Twitter and Friendfeed  I know a lot of people that love it so Ill keep it at a I like it	Amazing  The future of music!	Flickr is a great way to share photos online  Probably the best that Ive seen yet	I use Mobile Me to keep everything connected  But I see why people like gmail	Last fm is better  But Pandora would be in 2nd place:	Twitter is THE BEST SOCIAL NETWORK on the internet! Follow me on Twitter @ChrisWMartin	Best bookmarking site  You can access your bookmarks anywhere  I use it every day and have over 70 bookmarks!	A must add to your RSS reader	I use TweetDeck as my main twitter client  But  the only problem is that it uses a lot of API requests (Which is pretty much refreshing Twitter)	Best RSS reader!	Defiantly the BEST blogging platform  EVER	There are some downsides (like being slow)  But its made for the iPhone and iPod   you cant beat it	I dont like the community at all  The only reason that this is staying at a like is because some people make good videos (*some* people)	Its ok  Diggs better  Or at least thats what I think	Really useful  And fun too!	By far the BEST Twitter iPhone app and the updates keep makeing it better  Ps  Im glad to see some iPhone apps on here	Theres better  But RTM is good	I just found it and its really cool  You take a picture on your phone and email it to Posterous and its uploaded to your website	GREAT! Perfect for Twitter users because you write reviews in 160 letters or less  (just like how Twitter uses 140 or less)	Its ok  but for my current background Im using the old school Photoshop method	Its fun  Im not sure how its very useful  But its fun	Yes! Just yes	An OK browser but Firefox and Chrome are better	Really great and useful  You should check this out	Really good app  But Im not a big Skype person	Not the best  Dare I say overrated?	Its Great  Twitter Search is coming close though	I really love it  Just try it out	I love GreaseMonkey! Very useful!	Great browser! But     I would say Safari beats it	Its hard to beat Twitpic  but TweetPhoto is coming close	Ive used Chrome  Its pretty cool but (In my opinion) Its not the best browser out there	Its ok  I wish it had a better way to get on the front page	I like it but I like TweetDeck more	Its good but Im getting a Mac soon	I was a little late to start useing this but once I did I couldnt stop!	Mashable is THE BEST social networking website	I had it ever since it was a jailbroken app  Its great but the only downside is the music	Hulu is a very good website for streaming TV shows! But there are two problems: The commercials and the buffering (Which Probably cant be fixed)	I didnt like it to much when I tried it  I might try it again		
15431	i love it! cant wait to see how social ads are monetized correctly		
9875	Webs new sensation		
41701	Its a great place to conect with your friends and family		
96895	nice feature for those who need to share something with their email pals but dont have any FB  Twitter  account etc		
35029	Hope they release it really soon	best browser based game		
35028	Accurate results in an intuitive interface  Unfortunately: Arial  Square Button	Pure Mac simplicity  A bit crap on Windows  but on OS X theres nothing better	Indispensable  although the UI feels a little clunky for some reason	Beautiful  speedy and very simple  Still has quite a few UI annoyances though	IMAP  great UI  fast  conversations	I cant wait  Apart from anything else  kill the subject line! This really is the future of email	A very different workflow to Windows and Ubuntu  but everything is so much simpler and theres no messing around in the system if you dont want to  Also  BSD	Best interface for Flash video  but the T&C scare me slightly	Who knew 140 characters could be such an important addition to my life? You just cant understand it until you use it		
35026	Great for web development because of the powerful plugins	This is going to be friggin awesome!	It gets the job done  I cant wait until we do most of what Flash does nativly in the browser	Looking forward to Snow Leopard :)	Clean and elegant  my browser of choice		
82256	like listening to tunes xx		
60004	i would like to chat with my friends		
23055	Quick and easy way to create branded Twitter backgrounds	Best blog platform imo		
9869	It is great for fun  sharing professional info and networking!		
8537	Tweetdeck and I have a love hate relationship	Firefox continues to be the browser of choice!		
15439	Love it  sometimes the (is it adsense or keyword?) adverts freak me out a little though		
75968	best webmail   THERES NO DOUBT ABOUT IT  its name has now become synonymous with EMail	The BEST MEDIA PLAYER		
15438	best browser for addons and you get props for using open source	best reader  even does mp3s	best search engine  beats wolfram hands down	very good blogging tool	micro blogging service with the most users  getting spammy though	good interface  really easy to use	similar to tumblr  i like		
15437	still need more of my friends to join	im more browser based so i dont use that much yet i like how you can view everything at once		
8554	A mastodon and heavy browser  but yes  there is the best and most complete	Simply  the definitive email		
37673	I dont see the point  but  hey  everyone else is using it  A bit like Facebook  only less time consuming		
8555	fast  easy  give it half a year extra for the noobs	nice  but be careful in using it		
36343	HI THIS IS SATYA REDDY JUST NOW I ADDED		
62675	I am always stuck with Google in my life :D		
62676	I am always stuck with Google in my life :D		
50691	I could not live without this   Run both my business and personal email with this   Fast  multiple points of entry  and well designed	Its fast   My one issue that I NEED is groups		
15409	Twitter is ridiculous! (In a good way)	The perspective is wonderful  Just like Beth Midlars song God Is Watching Us		
85314	i love it so muck thats like my life		
8549	Bandwagonism maybe  but when something is this flexible and powerful  just gotta love it		
49652	I love love love it! I have reconnected with so many lost friends  Most I thought I would never ever see or hear from again but wanted to		
11044	99% of the time  i use SU on the web		
15401	The most competent browser  sure its slow  but compare it with IE8 and this is MUCH more stable   Also recommended on the Mac	Probably the best operating system I have ever used  and Im comparing it to Windows 2000!  Highly recommended  but dont impulse upgrade if you have Tiger 10 4	What I use day in day out   A great microblogging tool  and it can get addictive! D:		
85310	Me encanta Brizzly  un cliente para twitter desde la Web que me deja disfrutar de todo en un mismo sitio	He probado varias plataformas de Blogging  pero ninguna me convence  Por su facilidad y por su configurabilidad  me sigo quedando con Blogger		
11049	Can imagine life without it anymore		
37679	I dont expect to have to pay someday for all my great Google tools  They are not Microsoft  They are funded by their carefully placed ads  Good for G and me		
36348	Good but I have to tweak it massively on my eeepc 701  I use it on my desktop  still deciding between Tweetdeck and Seesmic for dominance on my pc	Love Ubuntu  I have used Ubuntu since 5 04  It is very easy to perform administrative tasks on  The beauty of Ubuntu though is its community	Just started my blog here a few days ago  I like the interface and the whole user experience	Seesmic  seems more stable than Tweetdeck  Let me clarify   more stable on my linuxbox		
11048	This is great  Ill look for you on Twitter  Jennifer!		
82283	Somehow I lost the music in my 30s and now its back with a vengeance  Spotify is superb!		
11052	In Love with Photoshop for the last 10 years	gets the job done for all us pirates out there  :)	Awesome product for transferring files between colleagues or friends and so easy to use	Email could not be better than the worlds best spam filter and innovative email hand down over anyone  Cant recommend it enough!	Best blogging software hands down  Use it everyday for my company blog  Love the extensions and the easy customization!	The best home for all things social networking!	Wish it had a My Profile Option  Other than that great Ipod touch tweet free app	Its addicting  but lacks tons of features I could see integrated  One Id like is a box for What am I listening to? that would rock  But nonetheless use it	If it was not for the memory hog bizness I would love Firefox  Unforrtunately b/c of this I had to switch to Chrome which is more memory hog unfriendly :)		
8568	Google has the fastest browser on the market  Chrome is really fast and powerful		
11051	It is an awesome site for business and for fun!		
72001	Communication brings us closer to one another		
74663	I am glad for living simultanous so many existences

263	Id pay the sub $5 for tweetie (and Id pay it monthly if needed)  Its great and recommended		
85308	Totally cool site   i love the deals		
35006	Great service to discover new websites  One big downside: You can not share your favorites easily		
86635	I truly tried to use Wave  but the problem is that I  just like many others  do not really get the idea behind it   GOOGLE  needs to further develop it		
37664	Great semantics  works great as a CMS  Best blogging platform out there	Best RSS reader available  even superior to any desktop application that attempts the same thing	Underrated  Great mobile OS  and open source too	More space than I would ever need  fast  works great  and has great add ons as well	Always fast  even though its funded by donations  Great source of info		
11055	Cool ideas to organize bookmarks	Best Email = Gmail		
1928	o plurk Ã© mais legal   ;x ehuheuhe	a good app :D

15411	Firefox is the best  nuff said		
37667	Pretty much negates any need for me to jailbreak my iPhone   For Now	My favourite out of all the free iPhone Twitter apps Ive used   I use it all the time	iTunes on Windows is much better than many people say  Ive used it for years  even before I had an iPod  Shame about the odd niggle though

13682	Gmail is intuitive  seems every time I look back  theres something new  cant live without conversation grouping either  And also its simple	Firefox is simply the most flexible browser out there  I can customize it just how I want  Ad block is ecentual also  I just love it		
49635	We love WordPress  Thank you Automattic	We love the homepage redesign  A really subtle way to introduce facebook users to real time feeds		
12350	while I was an early adopter of myspace  I found that from a usability POV Facebook was better  From a customisation stance  I still prefer Myspace		
72012	Google wave allows for instant viewing and use of items not available in IM (documents  charts etc )  The concept is awesome  and its not there yet  but soon	Whatever they did with Wordpress  the did it right  Other Blog services should mimic this platform as much as possible		
97310	best blogging ever seen i like it		
97312	Simple  fast  light		
65724	love is a treat but sometimes that treat comes to late

53740	its a great way to stay in touch  though the quizzes get quite irritating  but nonetheless  if you love to socialise  you have to be there		
60035	i  like talkin 2 ma dorkz n it awesome		
16712	Spotify is fantastic   am amazed that some people havent heard about it or assume its illegal  Play free  streamed music  huge library	Definitely my favourite browser     on Mac and PC  With this and Firefox I dont understand why anyone uses Explorer		
11023	Max Engel  the 8 bit Kid  is bringing MySpace back   just yall watch		
13687	Great resource  quick and easy way to look up almost anything		
11026	Going from Chrome to IE  or even Firefox  is like trading in a Porche for a Pinto   Google Chrome ROCKS		
45271	The best company in the world (after Apple of course:)	Huge variety of music	The best OS until Snow Leopard	Greate  like Tweetie for Mac	Its cool  waiting for iPhone client	The best Twitter client for Mac ever!	Perfect browser  but still need to pass Acid3	Useful app  but a bit expensive	Greatest brain in the web	Greate music player  itunes store is the bigest music/movies store  Appstore is also awesome	Help to keep in touch with friends far away	Great browser  Should be more native for Mac OS X		
36328	If it isnst Google or Apple  I dont want it! Just kidding  or am I?		
11028	twitter is a game changer  changed how we work and connect everyday  every minute		
8585	theres e mail  and then theres Gmail		
97307	Its Clean And simple to Use Its an effective web browser with much addons supporting		
8583	TweetDeck is impeccably designed and SO useful  Obsessed with the groups feature  It uses a lot of memory  though		
72027	Works awesome  File sharing  storage and versioning all rolled into one application  Even better when used with symbolic links		
13692	All In One  one stop solution for browser choice	one click away thats it Simple but powerful		
72023	Google Wave is amazing! but Im learning how to use and I need more friends   XD	Its the best web bowser

13697	Simple to use  amazing UI  tons of features and multiple accounts!	Great for reconnecting with old friends		
12367	Firstly  the interface is brilliant  And secondly  I can access my email from everywhere  Brilliant service!		
46595	Best site for movies		
87983	A nice simple URL shortner with analytics	A simple web design editing software  Not only that you can use it to quickly edit and crop images  Fast start up and very easy to use	Very easy to blog  Simple and is fast  All you do is use your email and post	A must have tool for your computer  It cleans up a lot of junk at the same time	An awesome site to check out videos  Also useful for education sometimes  Failblog channel is my personal favourite	The best mail service out there  It is very fast and secure  Simple to use and is hassle free  Only problem is there is a lot of spam but it does get caught	Nothing to say except Google it! Best thing on the web!	Like many other Google products! I simply love this! I have all my feeds on here and can simple log in to my Google account and check it all at one place	Best paid twitter app there is! Nice UI and there are no faults for me	Good source of information but sometimes not reliable but good to check simple trivial questions on there	It is now my default broswer  As many other Google products it is simple and easy to use  The bookmark sync feature is awesome	The best blogging platform there is  Easy for learners and you can edit it as much as you like  Also you can connect to your blog via email and apps	Best social networking site out there! Also best time waster online! Good to talk to friends and share photos	This is one of my main sources of social media news  It is updated very often and is very resourceful		
1948	tons of space  great clean interface  I prefer this over software mail now!	It is good for what is there  but choice for TV is limited  even if they have a show they only show 3 or 4 at a time	I think Google has started to lose traction as a search in the last couple of years  but it is still consistently good	I have to admit  this is a really nice tool for twitter  though most useful if you follow too many people and twit too much	It is a really easy app for blogging  The plug ins allow for more powerful tools  though they often go neglected	For what it is  I think it is the best of its kind  I personally dont like these types of things though	I love it  thinking of getting a text plan just so I can twit on the go	Not a bad blog for the socialsphere of the internet	It is very fun to play with  and very cool for a map program as well  I like finding new places with it	It is still a good resource but the interface seems to get worse with time	It is really hard to find anything decent on it  the lack of real programming also hurts it  Can still be fun  but just difficult to find it		
85321	I mainly use it for the stats  and I fucking love stats  Stats  man! Its also pretty great to find and keep track of events	Clean UI and great extensability  Publishing and organising is a lot of fun  Pro account is cheap and worth it  Free account is very limited		
13696	is the raging present and a lot of our future		
12365	allows me to organize twitter! create groups  search and integrate Facebook  love it!		
38977	love it  dont love Facebook		
86650	Recent newbie  starting to get drawn into the big black time eating hole they call Tweeting		
12368	Steeped in self importance (like all social sites really)  but is good because its short (like this site)  so it works with my ADD	This is basically the only email I actually like to use  All other webmail should be this easy and intuitive		
38979	Im almost quitting my conventional weblog  Twit is faster and easier :)		
8595	Seamless integration between Amazon S3 and OS  Automatic backup is really useful  Would love it if it could edit ACL		
61384	i love some one    i need he for life		
74699	It was a superb idea while it lasted but since the CBS buyout development has ground to a halt and I dont see the service being around much longer	An incredible idea but still a long way from people understanding its true potential I feel  perhaps when the APIs are more fleshed out	The only torrent client anyone should use on windows  I used to even use on linux through wine  its that good	A simple well though out system only marred by a couple of rather large compatibility bugs and a few problems with the auto fill system picking the wrong movie	Fast became an essential way to keep in touch with my friends  plus play some fun games  But I trust Zuckerberg about as far as I could throw this planet	An excellent Twitter App only let down by the fact it runs on the AiR platform which is terrible	A superbly simple way to keep yourself up to date on all your sites news and articles  the best reader I have ever used	Simple and blindingly fast that takes full advantage of the hardware I give it  Exactly what an OS should be	Almost overnight became an absolutely essential communication and news tool  hope they find a revenue model soon	Simply the definition of speed when browsing the web  still needs some work on the extension API like it needs the ability to stop elements from loading at all		
97335	too nice   its even getting addictive		
74694	Gotta love the connectivity potential	THE source of info on the net  period  Some may question its accuracy since anyone can edit  but they arent clear on the sites edit policies and QA protocol	I love the social take on music; I enjoy sharing my track history and listening to tunes in my Library	Fast becoming my favorite browser  though Google has A LOT of work to do on this incomplete and buggy prototype	Love WP and have for several years  Think Ill be loving it for many more years to come	The best email app ever; nothing else stands up  Period	By far the BEST browser out there today  though Chrome is fast encroaching  Ive found Firefox to become somewhat bloated and slow due to addon instability	Great resource for trading information in any niche community; though the aspect of insignificant chatter from many users can annoy me		
59068	tell people twitter and they listen even MPs Its Awesome!!		
53763	Great wish I could get on my iPhone  damn apple I have loved them for years but now they have grown more into pop culture they now have a big ego for problem		
37632	After over a month Im still using the free version of Twitterfon  Its quick and stable  does everything I need  and the ads arent intrusive  Why pay more?	Never used the previous versions  but 3 0 does more than I ever though a phone could do  With th right apps  the features like the compass become essential		
11003	The only issue is they write too many articles a day  which it makes a RSS no so attractive	The best OS right now in the world		
77736	it just works! they do have awful user agreements if you happen to have read them  but who doesnt?! let us hope they will never be abused		
38965	First twitter!  Not sure its worthwhile!!!!		
52435	its gettin better and better

52444	Ease of use  reliable and saves time  Excellent		
34596	I tried a lot of notepad programs  this one is the best  And it is free  Cant think of living without the macro function anymore	No need to install media codec packs and stuff  this is the only media player you need	The only torrent client i use  very easy to use and fast  what do i need more?	the best search engine there is	Very useful once you understand it and have found the right people to follow		
53772	Buenas  yo quiero una invitacion   mi correo es admin@elmundo55 es

12347	I love being able to store my own images  as well as see what the world has shared	I use the non Labs desktop client and it rocks  Use the call feature to talk with family   Searchable conversation history in Gmail is really handy	If it doesnt scrobble  I dont want to listen to it!  Love having listening stats   Along with Pandora  a great way to discover new (or not so new!) artists

32848	I like it but hardly ever use it	I go on twitter! It is fantastic and people around the world know what youre doing!	Calling other people from the computer is a great idea	It is alright and extra space for mails is cool	Best search engine in the web!

A good way to discover new music  and a great way to make a large itunes esque music library with no downloads  Seamless streaming too!	The best social music site at the moment	This is definitely a good twitter app  though there are a few bugs here & there with the 12 seconds recording etc   Highly recommended all in all	Cant really say anything about youtube that hasnt already been said  It rocks    Just dont like the muting theyve been doing to some vids  :/	The best torrent program Ive used	Google tops everything    its not because they have a hand in everything  its that the implementation is so much better	Great app  just wish I could properly use my iphone with it	Great site to aggregate your web life    connect it to Facebook for the ultimate sharing combo	Its a great app  but between my wordpress blog and twitter  it makes it kinda redundant	Essential if you use Firefox	One of the best wordpress comment plugins out there    Tops disqus in my opinion	I use wordpress with my blog at www jamesbuckingham com   the best blogging platform available  :)

45	Its fun  super easy to use  and a little bit addicting  sort of like how Facebook is a little bit addicting	Unlimited storage  no deleting  super easy searching of everything ever sent or received  plus a good chat tool and other extras  Gmail rocks my socks	Kinda sad  I hardly even scan the actual news for headlines anymore since my friends status updates keep me in the loop  Its a great way to stay connected	Does anyone even use that Other Browser anymore? I love the plugins  switching between tabs by keyboard shortcut  and I love that it saves my tabs when I exit!		
61481	To be in touch with friends all over the world!	Cant live without it! (very geek lol)

1218	A simple and clean interface makes the whole experience of blipping a joy  The recommendations I have received have proven to be inspired  so go blippr!	The more you use it the better it gets  Programs such as scrobblers help make the process of finding or being recommended new music nice and simple	Gmail changed the way I use e mail and I would struggle to go back now  Innovations such as conversations and labeling make e mail a quick and simple process	A powerful and creative image editor and creator  There really are no limits to what you can achieve with it  especially after learning how to use it fully	A great place to share your photos and get tips from those you meet  It is easy to discover truly incredible images and photographers and interact with them	I must admit that I was a fan of Vista once the kinks had been worked out of it but Windows 7 is a step up  Fast and easy to use with some great little touches		
46834	but i keep having problems loggin in  i have reported this and no one has got back to me  i have reported this problem several times over the last 3 days

79766	love is very important but with careful  also like to be loved		
53158	Just recently started using Opera  and have become a big fan  Anything with open development is always a good thing  in my opinion  Web 5 0 is their hi point	I somewhat like Pandora radio  but I was referred here from Avatar Pandora  lol	Love it  Love it Love it  But only with latest stable release  Feature rich  supports 1000s of plug ins & best of all  its not IE  #Opensource	Its becoming more and more of a source of quick up to the minute information hub  It really is a social network hub  but is also more	Great if not greatest micro blogging media hub  Always the latest trending & of debate  10 out of 10 from me	A must have for those of us that enjoy and want to easily share content to our favorite social media hubs  a 10/10 from me		
87389	Im still committed to it  Theres lots of potential left  Maybe marry it to Buzz?		
3888	Its good but  for me  its memory hungry and very slow!  I use it mainly for the sidekicks  Last fm and iLike sidebars	Good  just wished scripts worked properly (or at all in the alpha/2 0 version) in Google Chrome	A must have for Firefox users  though I use Chrome now  ; )	I dont really use its unique features but might do once it swaps to Google Chrome from Firefox	Excellent new service from Kosmix  personalising your newspaper is dead simple and it looks very neat too   Very customisable	OK but Disqus is the king at the moment	Excellent service  love the scrobbler  love that thesixtyone works with it   Get good recommendations   Not as good as Pandora  but cant use Pandora now	Love it  I swapped to Gmail permanently a year or 2 ago   Now only use Outlook to download a backup of my mail	A must have for any Windows user   I wished updating it was easier though	Looks a good alternative to WMP and iTunes	Great to have an online version of Word  be it a basic alternative	This is potentially very useful   If the bookmarklet was tweaked I think I would use it regularly so will keep an eye on this service	Perhaps not liked as much as previous  I still use it to find cool stuff and the recommendation engine seems to work for me	Not really used but I can see this being very useful	Pretty useful Twitter directory	Potentially a very good app   But it needs FriendFeed support for me and needs to do a far better job at it than Twhirl ever did	Good site  but discarded it as I use too many such services   If there was a way to submit to it when I bookmark/like on other services then great  but alas	Potentially very useful   A good service already could be great once this new all in one comments service (seen on Mashable) is released	Nice app/service but not used it much	I used to use this all the time but its one of the services Ive discarded like Delicious  still very good though	Best news reader around	Brilliant  I found LOTS of new music with this   I just wished it worked outside of the US again  : (	I wish this was far more popular than it is   I prefer this over Twitter but everyone uses Twitter  simple as that   The responded tab is cool	I only speak for the music site: I like a lot   I check the featured artists each week and regular search for music or new artists	One of the best sites on the Internet   Great community  superb features that are being added to and updated all the time and very addictive   Love it!!	I need to try this more but it seems pretty useful	Twitter is my FriendFeed messaging sidekick  ; )	The best of its type  just fix that annoying jumping up and down upon liking items on FriendFeed please!	Love it  yeah there might be the odd mistake here and there but its the reference site of choice for me   The design is great!	Excellent site  a regular read for me	Im undecided on the best social media site for us book fans but this is certainly in the top 3	Lots of fun and interesting to see the rest of the World   Very  very useful	Pretty cool but I couldnt get into it   Im keeping an eye on it though  : )	Ive never really used it but it looks a very useful app	Well they have lots of cool stuff  the search site  the browser  etc	Even though theyve started removing music videos from the UK on YT its still the video site I go to first	Lots of information here  perhaps could do with a lick of paint here and there  : )	Use this to play DVDs  very simple and useful	Its got its critics but I like it  Most stable version of Windows Ive personally used   Just wished it was faster   Windows 7 looks nice though	Good site  well theyve bought this site so gotta say I like them  ; )	Not perfect but its support for so many services wins it for me	Potentially a very useful and interesting service   Looking forward to the upcoming WP plugin which Ill definitely add to my site		
86084	finally just got the blackberry app and so far so good   its a lot of fun!		
69503	hmmmm   so far so gud		
66477	Your opinion of this app in 160 characters ohttp://www blippr com/home/edit/servicesr less		
2571	I just wish more of my friends used it!	Ties together all your social networking needs into one  Firefox based browser  Still has teething problems but once you use it you wont want anything else		
74099	now days i am unable to log in properly as well as attachment of certain files  This has been experienced in the recent past Any technical problems please		
53161	Sounds great!  Looking forward to a new communication venue!  Sindy		
83805	Twitter is more for functionality than social networking  in my opinion		
83811	cool  style able		
10877	It has the best design of all time  No other website even comes close to it in terms of freshness and simplicity		
79794	Twitter the Town Cryer of our generation  Love it!		
49091	Kool way to stay connected with your professional colleagues		
78468	So far  its great  That said  I havent had to do a restore  But you can map the cloud space as a drive  so direct file access shouldnt be a problem

80768	Very useful and a wealth of information		
46818	Nice   It does not support plug ins like FireFox   It is faster then Firefox or IE   Wish it has a few more configurable option in the preferences

28161	To heck with MTV  I want my Google Wave!!!!!!	Google has it GOING ON In the morning when I get on the net  its like Christmas when I see a new GOOGLE App	Its very sociable  I like Twit Army as well  its Twitter only more directed to a particular group of people with the same interest!  COMPUTERS!!!!		
10883	heyy! thats G R E AT :)		
33504	I found blippr through StumbleUpon! Not recommended for the procrastinator!		
92784	Still getting to grips with how I can use it to its full potential to expand my business network online	Drop Box is really excellent online sharing and collaboration tool   works perfectly with our Apple Macs	How could you not love the power of Photoshop   awesome program!	Just getting the hang of using it at the moment but   it seems really good for managing all of our social media accounts in one place   plus we love the stats	Perfect choice for us   Firefox everytime	The best thing for international calls  As Long as you dont mind wearing a headset :)	Use it everyday   normally it works perfectly  but sometimes it can be having a bad day and take forever to load	I use this to update and review all of the my tweets   has worked well for me so far		
91458	Finally  intelligent two way social communication		
90127	Not quite ready for prime time  but with time it will be compelling		
46809	Great to find new interesting or funny photos  but you dont get much space unless you pay $25/year	Good  but the ads are very repetitive		
58871	Twitter Is The Opium Of The Masses		
2592	Finding it useful  but messy		
37093	Really The God Father of Streaming Videos		
57545	i love facebook cause its hot		
34821	I love this wonderful application  only need net social functions to be totally perfect

57541	hahahahaha cool as lol (:		
56213	i like to fly with my girl  but no girl friend		
70504	I think its great     but could do with more intergration from google chat     Would be nice to be able to use it in a desktop app rather than on the browser		
66491	its cool to know what everybody is doing  Your friends  family and even celebs!	nice site  useful reviews but not working very good in IE8 (so i need to turn on compatibility view)		
68203	Great Themes  Plugins   easy to use  install and understand! I Love Wordpress! :D	Haha i love Facebook all those hours i waste on it :P	Love it! Fast  Great Add ons  Themes   much better than any other browser out there! :D	How can you not like Google    unless you work for Microsofts Bing		
65175	i love google   they are a very unique company   they are capable of doing anything and have the resources and money to do it  they are the modern day microsoft	i like it but its a little TOO OPEN   i need a little privacy   why should all my friends see what all my other friends are saying to me		
68202	yea its good i like facebook		
70521	It works  Hate the cones though		
69535	I lurve it    as long as it can show me what i want to see from this website   heehehhe		
29473	Its great  as long as youre clear what you want to get out of it  otherwise the novelty wears off pretty quickly	Skype and Facebook chat worked easy peasy on my N82  whats not to like?		
31785	Just started using this  Great access to music  but navigating the site is difficult	Best browser out so far		
29479	results should be more graphical  and more organized  not just a plain listing		
77148	 Another time  i shall give to you my opinion on it  after to have taken a little moment to see it very well  Okay  bye and next time !		
10861	Tumblr is a great way to share snippets of the web with little to no commentary  Simple and easy to update	Great time waster  Good way to discover different parts of the web	Gwibber is a microblogging app that updates twitter  identica  jaiku and the like with your status updates  Runs on Linux only	Gmail is the only email I need	I think this is the only way to read RSS feeds  The best web based reader	Awesome program  just needs identi ca and friendfeed for me to fully embrace it	Great program to manipulate photos and other pictures	Linkedin is good for business related connections	Simple way to integrate comments into your site  I use it for Tumblr	Microblogging  Thats all I have to say	Plurk is simple and fun to use as a microblogging site  No API gives it a lower rating from me though	Good  but not as good as it could be    especially after requiring people from other countries to pay to use their radio service	Friendfeed is easy to use and improving all the time		
50922	Great app  makes me want a smartphone		
70517	Just fine  The app on blackberry needs to be improved		
49063	i love facebook x :)

10829	Newcomer to last fm  but instantly hooked		
57562	I think blippr is cool!!!!!!!!!		
77174	They say that knowledge is power therefore sharing knowledge is a means of empowering others and increasing common understanding  which makes a better world	Very convenient way of summarising your background acting as a virtual resume		
90141	I think google buzz will be better once people on google buzz talk about more than google buzz and whether google buzz is better than twitter or facebook		
90140	I havent seen a TON of difference between this and twitter other than you can post longer sentences and your profile is more accessible to strangers		
56238	the only think that might could be better is wave :p		
29444	An easy interface for reviewing stuff  Custom tweet format would be nice		
83852	I love it  but i would love even more  if Google would buy it  so i could use my 80GB Google Storage		
50930	Its fun  App invitations get annoying though	My favorite email service		
5634	The entire file sharing is easy even newbie also could use it I get extra space every time invite my friends Lack of pain neck features is major note	Decent fast & pretty cool data transfer at a time Throw your portable devices if you dont like or hate this coolest data transfer app Youll lose easiness	Having own blog & domain is really possible with blogger service Just simple as a piece of cake Just sign up with e mail ID & get to your blogging world	I like the wordpress theme & the surrounding for its classy clean & eye appeal outlook which completely deviate from normal blog	Array of colour schemes & fonts to choose on  It makes tweet updates more interesting Its worth using	Its really good idea but Im always scared with the over expose features which can make criminals to get information easily Seriously consider this  !!!	Its a HUGE WORLD for videos You just name it  IT will play it	Unlimited titles & topics to find out  Real feed for information seekers Youll never dry out information	Its really recommend for twitter junkies/crazies who have huge number of friends  Its looks bit professional with quite impressive features	At least you get something to share with your friends for idle talk	Its just like view photos on Apple Macbook Exciting & utter classy to browse images The 3D way & smooth scrolling is absolutely cool	Google never need to be explained why its an excellent search engine	Its very very basic and simple app & its really recommend for twitter newbies No pain neck settings nor features to choose on Yeah its only add on what  hmm	I dont know which platform will be the best place to share the crisp clear photos none other than Flickr itself	Come on man  Its cool windows that Im using right now  since 98	Whats more better in online activities if not share the link & bookmarks in a single room	Same UI like Tweetdeck but I still prefer Seesmic for its better management system Kinda easy	Cool to share multimedia contents reviews opinions & views in a single platform	Who dont like to browse web with smooth & speed? Opera is my 2nd choice after FF   Excellent Fast & Clear  Absolutely brilliant choice	It makes the browsing session extremely cool & exciting	Im simply LOVE this app its a fantastic way to connect with buddies & at the same time can spread the word in single update Kudos to the founders   !!!

There are plenty of ways to update files between multiple computers and get online storage  but this one just works and you never have to think about it  Great!	Nothing amazing  but its a decent idea in todays fast moving Internet driven world  although it is used for entirely the wrong purpose much of the time	Destined for greatness (I hope)  No need to carve a new niche  just do it better than Twitter  and the user base is already there	imeem was a truly outstanding service until it was gobbled up and utterly destroyed by MySpace last December  Thanks a lot  MySpace	Linked in is very powerful for professionals  though its not always easy or obvious how to use it to its fullest potential  Needs an overhaul  but recommended!	A good alternative to the overly bloated and frantic MySpace  and it offers far more features and tools than Twitter  But those apps and games are so annoying!	Amazing mobile OS  period  The devs at Google have done something truly special with Android and I can no longer see it being anything other than my #1 choice

8818	Gmail is the best e mail application there is  I always found Hotmail and Yahoo mail to be ugly and old fashioned  but then Gmail came along  Fabulous	It may be a little slower than a couple of other browsers  but its major advantage is all the plug ins  The best out there and miles better than IE

75475	Wikipedia is the best overall resource Ive used PERIOD	Best browser IMO		
66526	SU is unique among bookmarking and related sites  I like using it  The social elements of it are lacking (or just not really happening)  though		
48717	I have drunk the kool aid and now I can run a four minute mile with Google at my side!		
543	My premium e mail client	With more friends joining in its the best place on the web;)	The easiest bloging tool which is becoming more and more addictive	Simply amazing photo hosting site	The easy bloging tool for the rest of us;)		
31042	prefer Tumblr as it is faster  but Flickr is handy	For a non programmer like me  Wordpress and its army of plugins is the bizniss		
32373	Fantastic for finding new music  even if its far from mainstream!	Good  But a complete memory hog	No nonsense app  No bloated features  just what you need	Its whatever you want it to be  Without it  blippr wouldnt exist!	Good   but lacking the equivalent of Firefoxs extensions  Till it has add on support  Im staying with Firefox	Good for connecting with people you may not otherwise keep in touch with  But bloated  applications are unstable  chat is rarely working   too much like myspace

10126	A really good multi im client out there  Very functional and good looking but bulky and cumbersome at times  Can improve a lot and has got potential to be best!	Simple  elegant  effective and a great community  Beats all other photo sites by miles	The best microblogging platform cum social aggregator site out there  Whatever is out there friendfeed is two steps ahead in terms of thought and action	life becomes so simple with this brilliant note taking app which creates various notebooks and keeps all ur notes at one place accessible over the cloud	Am a huge fan of firefox  Cant live w/o it  Totally changed the way I use internet! The add ons make it so functional and knockout every other browser out there	Fast  Very fast  thats good  Simple  too simple  Thats bad  Having no add ons is a severe handicap  Several sites still dont run properly on it	One of the best things on the internet right now  It is status updates+blogging+im+networking+awesomeness	It is THE BEST twitter client for desktops for heavy twitter users  Supreme functionality & constant innovation make it awesome  It is also one of best AIR app

8883	I cannot express in words how much I love Mashable! Its the first email I open when I get to work and it takes priority over the next 30 minutes  Best source	Good page source  Submission process is a bit tiring  but keeps info relevant for the most part	I really like iTunes  I know most hate having to pay but aside from that I love the fact that I can buy a cd at 3:15am and have it loud & clear in a minute	Good for online shelf  Appearance wise this is the best of the virtual shelves  Clear cover pics and fancy cases	Of course  But Im pissed about the cost of upgrading	Fun for those times you have time  Takes you to some rarely seen sites that should be seen more often  Also helps organize your personal favorites	Extensive and comprehensive  My favorite online library site  Definitely the best web library for all info regarding the book world	Lots of options and control for all Twitter accounts	Grand  Great starting point for any kind of research  Info is usually reliable and correct    but I always re check it  Format is perfect for an encyclopedia	I used to love it  now it becomes closer facespace every day  But it is the easiest way to keep in contact with far away friends	Great site  lots of info & interesting sites  I have found some really neat things via Digg  But at times I wish theyd believe me that my submission is unique	Works great  I find it easy to navigate and customize  I need a bigger bookmarks bar though	Without WordPress were would all the web words go? Lame  I know  But WordPress isnt  By far the best and most complete blogging service out there	I like it for quickly keeping bookmarks  Good at sorting through tags and categories	Im waiting for the day when Google simply doesnt blow my mind  Google Earth vastly went beyond anything I had expected of it

81290	Have been using it more since getting a netbook    i find it requires a decent size screen		
81292	Its simply brilliant  Its based on the same philosophy as 37signalss services  I bet it will have a lot of cool features in the future		
14459	pandria com  nuff said!	I think its a great communication and networking tool  plus  its fun to sit and read through what others are doing at the exact same moment you are!	Only been using it a short while  but seems okay so far	My boyfriend just turned me on to Google Reader  I can now easily surf all of my news  including Mashable and Digg at the click of ONE button and in only 1 Tab!	I often refer to IMDB for info on movies  actors  and upcoming films!	I love Firefox  I have converted many friends to it  far away from IE  The customization it has is just fantastic!		
13128	The best way to get your twitter and facebook updates & keep them organised  The layout is simple & clear  you can create groups & it has useful link shortner	Has its flaws but generally speaking a revolution in communication  I use it for work and hobbies  Its great for news debate and its a great networking tool		
71019	The shopping search and cashback feature are great		
72349	lets see         idont have much idea?

39744	Looks really cool  in terms of function  but I dont like having their brand look so prominent on our site	Handy  but not very sleek  Good for tweet categorisation	The definitive movie database  Design looks a bit dated though  and not very interactive	This is their original  and still their best piece of technology ever	Makes a helluva lot of user satisfaction / PR mistakes but still the best social network out there	Usually interesting  I still prefer TechCrunch for getting news first	Great concept  We use it all the time	Brilliant  Ground breaking	Extremely handy tool	Probably the most use app on our PCs	The most popular retweet counter being used on popular blogs  Also the most accurate	Probably the simplest and most usable Firefox   Twitter plugin	Extremely useful and brilliantly priced : )	Definitely the most powerful image editor  Using it for years  and still continue to discover cool new features	Nice to have  easy to use	Undeniably the best blog platform  Possibly the most powerful CMS too	Significant improvements over XP and Vista  Could be faster to boot  The inability to pin Mini Media Player to taskbar is a fail point	Love how much better Office 2007 is than Office XP  Lots more interesting features  Outlook 2007 should have HTML email support though	Good for the lazy / photoshop challenged	Brilliant for playing specific tracks  The radio function needs improvement badly	Interesting  Not sure if it will replace IMDB for movie recommendations  but      time will tell	Probably the best resource for stock photography	While the mobile browser itself is good  the mobile emulator is absolutely excellent for testing mobile websites	Changed the way we think about maps forever  Terrible with tiny by lanes in London  tho   those always get missed out on Google Maps but can be seen on Mapquest	Still good  Does exactly what it says on the box and has been doing so for almost as long as the Internets been around	Very useful if you want to grow your Twitter reach  However  the service can be quite slow	Favourite way to discover interesting new sites and while away hours on idle browsing	Refreshingly good  Doubt it will ever replace Google  but boy do I want it to!	Our desktop Twitter app of choice  Very handy for multiple accounts (office  personal etc) and lots of easy to use functionality without crowding the interface	The most popular (?)  Use it daily for all international communications and video conferencing	Good  good stuff	Very cool  but pointless for daily use	Definitely one of the best Twitter add on sites		
7568	youre on it blipping and blipping how can you say that you dont like this site ;)	Gmail is fantastic   I used to do all my works on it !	how cant you love this fabulous website with so many great applications   I never get tired of using it

50104	nice app  great stuff		
39728	My all time browser behind Opera  :P	I like it on my Linux machines	Tries its best to do what it does  but I think it needs MOAR work	Very cool for people with low space on their hard drive	I like Pandora  but the free accounts are annoying	Simply *THE BEST* e mail client out there	I use it for my blog and it is great!	Parts are free software  but the code to the browser isnt  Arora is a bit better	Newbies to computers will love it! I love it too!	An decent open source Photoshop	I use Identi ca as a alternate source for Twitter	Like the compelling upload video & picture site   but I dont use it and is owned by the News Corp	95% of people use it! I do too! Love the services!	Only Windows  Puuuu  But the accounts actually use XMPP/Jabber	I like Disqus  in it that in many ways	I love it! I even got a profile on it! (Only thing is that it is too popular)	Youll find many great sites	Google Analytics is glaring stats	Mostly GarageBand like NINJA90 says	It is good for finding information  but is spammed alot	And loving it thanks to Reader2Twitter	But alas flickrs better	Addicted to it like everybody!	Alerting me when social networking goes wild	I love it! (Especially the latest version  but it wont broadcast to FriendFeed)	Default URL trimmer for Twitter  and I use it sometimes	Its OK  but it really wants you to pay :(	I love it in the fact that is that is a open source media player   which is rare	OK and decent  but I think Ubuntu is a bit better	Great twitter tool	Cool tech blog		
9301	No other email client compares to Gmail	Clean interface  Google still needs to work out some JavaScript issues so that it is compatible with more web2 0 apps

15740	great way to share pictures on the go with friends  old and new

63422	Gmail provides good and quick service  it has added so much new and latest supports to its services   yeah  but gmail apps for window mobile are required		
75402	I love the refinements in the user interface in Windows 7  Pinning icons for your most used programs to the taskbar adds sophistication  Sexy  fast and simple!	Lets keep this short and sweet! For that is what blippr is all about!	Absolutely awesome music streaming service and I love the premium subscription which lets you use this on your iPhone and save off line playlists!	A much more powerful  faster  innovative and secure web browser  There are extensions for almost anything  Choose Firefox for a great web browsing experience	Mashable is the most amazing social media blog out there and I must confess that I honestly use this on a daily basis!	Wikipedia is a great concept but I feel that it is very much bloated and usefulness as well as reliability can be very questionable!	Great concept but this doesnt always work in practice! Improved accuracy would make this much more useful  Super app to discover music though!	I am #twitaddicted! Too many tweets  so little time! This is truly one of the most remarkable examples of web/social media innovation of our time!	This is THE definitive Twitter client app on the iPhone! Sexy and functional!

15748	Blows every other social networking and location based site out of the water  Inline pictures  comment capabilities  solid privacy features & a great community!		
39714	Couldnt live without twitter   check with me in 1 year  it could go the way of MySpace ;)	I wish it was easier to find old messages  once you trash them or send them  its like a needle in a haystack  is this beta still? LOL		
50117	awesome blogging platform with an excellent backend		
10058	See the world from your door step   know where youre heading to and with street view   guess I cant lost as easily now   Just need to plan ahead		
15746	Twitter can be so much more than a microblog/social network  If you want  it can condense your whole online life 140 characters at a time	A good blend between other blogging apps and Twitter  Its like blogging express  Couldnt be easier to use yet still suitable for advanced bloggers		
95008	The best of the best with the best!	Its not easy to describe it but really I cant open firefox without opening twitter tab  it became of primary websites I open daily  #thankstwitter4		
11390	I prefer this over Discus & Im a Wordpress follower  It also got bought up by Automattic (Wordpress developers) so it makes sense  It has plugins now too!	Simply the best  End of!		
10062	the place to update people i actually know		
75415	I loved t  but I need friends on it to really test its potential  Here is my Google Wave address: CCEJean@googlewave com		
9314	Amazing 3D way of searching the web for pictures  essential plugin for your internet browser  And free  too	+ The best starting point for any research of info or for any random learning trip   Not a 100% accurate or correct  serious purposes require cross checking

This a media album/scrapbook style blog  Works well for me	If you are at all involved with social networking  especially facebook & twitter  you must check out this browser  Its a quick setup as a spinoff of Firefox!		
15757	By far the fastest  Just needs AdBlock	Waiting for better integration with AI	Very cost effective    when pirated

71078	Virb com was good but what happened to the page design? Its kind of lame now almost like FB just    plain  no personalization	You have to be a member and signed int to listen or upload stuff but I think it is still the best social networking sites :)

37174	i like all the tools that it provides  but i still think google is more accurate		
9343	Nice interface  I can see why theres so much buzz over this	Great integration of IM and social networks  Ive been using it for a while on Windows but looking forward to the Linux port		
90169	Its okay  Id be happier to see more levels of privacy as easy to implement as Facebook  But its nice in that its all plugged into the Gmail interface  Nice		
69568	Like the safety of a linux os

95844	Best mail  faster than no other  thanks	I love it   me gusta   encuentro una fuente inagotable no solo de musica  pero tambien de expresiones culturales y mas		
90155	Interactive  instant and inimitable!		
9357	nobody would pay much attention to the bad proposition    $$$$ last fm = free  no pay!		
77182	I have used both and i like Bing a lot  It will not replace google for me soon however i thought why change from yahoo to google and i did  so who knows		
43843	Good job Kyle!	greatest tool ever for photography		
83859	twitter makes me better		
90150	I wish it would integrate with facebook and would update my twitter/facebook status when I buzz something		
61614	this is the kind of tool that will make our future on web		
90152	It is fine and is well integrated with Gmail and Google reader but is not a must use tool from my perspective		
61615	hahaha    hidup pnuh warna		
77188	awesome  and getting better every release		
31860	Good to communicate and know the reality of world		
10945	Has the potential to be the greatest single achievement of mankind   but Ill have to check my sources to be sure	I choose tweetdeck when I choose to twitter		
30532	I like chrome so much I installed it on the comp my parents use		
30531	i like it i because none my email my friend and my family!		
81200	I have not got the chance to use it  hope to use it more often soon		
10946	The new design and improved APIs really brought me back to Delicious after giving up on it a few years ago	Not the shiniest app Ive ever used but it gets the job done!

69572	make your life is easy   !!!!!!!		
89167	nice system build your team		
10940	Great service  easy and intuitive		
13183	Pete  tell me youre not the only one with access to your Twitter account  Or say that your fingers are on steroids  Explain  somehow  your incessant tweets!		
93214	clearly the best thats out there but still some bugs need to be worked out		
9366	Ive been a user for a whole 5 minutes  and I absolutely love this interface! I have to give blippr props for even interesting me in a site of this type		
13181	Its the window to the New Millinium! http://www erskien blogspot com		
13182	I always enjoy Mashable! Good info!		
94542	even though i havent checked it out but still ya get that XD		
73602	Pretty nice application		
90188	Has advantages and disadvantages  chief among the advantages being such great integration with other google service		
10907	There are so many  features on Flock it takes a while to use them correctly  but once learned I dont know how I got by without Flock		
95870	google is becoming evil however much we all like it		
43838	love it with all its bugs  (kill iTunes)	Great IM service  Wish they had more features for their desktop notifier	if u r not using it u better start now	very useful if you r using twitter	blip about blippr  hmmm  thats like go to google com and search for google com		
10909	I like it and feel that it will be improved in areas where it is not (being in alpha)		
10908	Easy to keep up with certain timely events  such as sports events  but becomes cumbersome at times; often  too many personal tweets from business oriented sites		
90180	I like Buzz and I think well see a lot of improvements as we go along		
9362	I said I love it    :D	its OK   but not so revolutionar as people thinking    simply OK   :)		
9360	I dont like being followed but if I can get a hot deal on sunglasses Im in!		
56271	cool  very cool  I am new here exploring	lets see  but looks it will be veeery good!		
90184	Its a smart  strategic move on Googles part since it allows them to take advantage of their whole platform on Android handsets (duh)		
83898	LOVED THAT SORORITY LIFE !		
10912	one of the best photo media sites ive ever come across  i urge everyone to get at least the free account if not the pro account  Its worth it by the way	i havent tried it much  but so far so good		
82563	i just like it and also can also learn from it :)		
29521	Its great but if youve been around online communication awhile it looks more like a radical re imagining of irc than something new	Mixed feelings  Phishtube good  Tila Tequila  well  journalists who claim twitter is changing our lives should be forced to watch her cam show  :P		
81234	I travel so much  its great to find new places		
13189	Cant make it through the day without a lil Mashable!		
49131	I HAVE JUST JOIN IT SO I HAVE RIGHT NOW NO REVIEW		
74927	Cant image my computer work without this program  And never will change it for analog  because it is the best one for manage torrents	Very good service and site usability  but if cancel 10min limit per video  it will be better!	Awesome statistics and software recommendations tracker!	My knowledge helper  Very useful during studies	Firefox   this is my internet! The best browser!	Great music community  the largest  library  recommendations and online radio  Bad that free only at USA  UK		
90176	Has great potential to rule the social networking world		
13195	Look forward to the informative tweets every day!  Petes picture is always worth waking up to as well		
40790	The extensions are great and I think its a developers as well as users browser		
90175	Trying to understand it but I like it		
74945	Really useful as I can access it so easily on my HTC Hero		
68267	Theres always something interesting  funny  amusing  touching  to find everyday  Simple and easy to use too  Makes everything much more fun		
13192	Suh weet   Im all about something that keeps me connected to the twitterverse without taking up tons of space		
90178	The Twitter feed isnt live; therefore  people are reading my 2pm tweet at 3 am		
13199	I often find the comments  tips and links to articles very useful  cool   Keep them coming		
13196	Mashable is my favorite resource for keeping up with social media		
93204	Its a really fun app  I just wish more people had it so we could all share the fun!	Its the best blog Ive ever used   I cant wait to try hosting on my own site		
37146	I love the idea behind this  Servers seem a bit sluggish though  ahhh  and a 504 error while trying to post THIS! needs some work	Best browser by far! Fast  sleek  lean & mean		
94535	Its opened up my city to me  I know that Im more likely to visit a place on here  even if just to become mare and its always a good time		
10918	I love Google Apps!!  I love the price and how it works and how it helps others that are just learning about technology learn easier!!   Googlz

62966	love to meet more friends here		
81219	Awesome search engine		
9372	I use Twitter as a real time search engine   Whenever Im looking for the viewpoint of the masses  Twitter delivers  Its not just for geeks anymore		
1400	its the juggernaut of web video		
82553	Lost 80% of the songs on my imeem playlists    songs that came from imeem  I despise these myspace dipshts  The big question: What site replaces imeem the best?		
82554	i love the game its great		
38478	Its user interface is awesome  but so is the browser itself  It renders pages accurately  and fast  Trumps Firefox in my opinion		
81220	i need a female friend		
14492	Twitter is addictive  It just gets easier to share thanks to Mobile Tweeting and firefox plugins  Its truly Micro Blogging	This is the only RSS feed colletor service I use  I simply love it the concept of RSS  Would love to see the concept of filters in GReader!		
13161	I have a love/hate with Yelp   love that it uncovers local places that wouldnt get noticed by media  but hate the meaningless star ratings system		
13162	Cant remember what I did before! Tremendous tool for realizing how the planet is not that big and were all very similar		
39795	Its best   but competitors are also performing   Now a days I am also opting for bing		
38464	love good jokes know any		
37135	easy to use easy to view!!		
62972	its the easies way to blog share ideas		
9380	This is really good  For all the stuff that you cant possibly get to read   file them into your Evernote account and access them on Mac  PC  web and iPhone		
8053	Blippr beat me in the eye with a stick	Robust and clean! Integrated chat  OCD enabling features  Its awesome and constantly getting better		
29508	Facebook is for your real friends  Twitter is for your online friends  Thats the way I look at it		
61639	Im a little slow on it  but am learning pretty quick dont love it dont hate it but im in between		
85611	Love the conversations in realtime  In that sense  is better than Facebook	Good organization: labels  filters  starred  No more spam in inbox (ok  almost)  I like labs  but is difficult to find what is enable	I have many addons (some uneccesary)  But so  I mustnt search every page  for example i have Gmail Notifier  The search bar is fantastic		
13169	It has a lot of useful information		
81251	Useful to keep track of my tasks for various projects  Good reminder functionality		
13167	Lots of good stuff  Lots of good starting points for further inquiry		
38469	i just love it very much		
90197	I think it is the best of the social media outlets  :)		
13170	Its one of my main resources for social media news  lists and howtos		
68289	it is good for me free music we will play  music all day long		
9398	its pretty cool seeing what the rest of the world is up to   its tweet :)	what can i say fb is just another addiction to add to the list   i just cant get enuff  :)		
13176	Mashable is relevant & well written  A great resource for bloggers & marketing professionals  Can count on it to cover the latest in the Web 2 0 world & beyond		
39783	great app in your iphone  I use it a lot!	Very fast and simple  Great combination		
73633	A great browser with an absurd potential  i hope the upcoming versions fix the bloating problems though	The fastest browser option  but still lacks something to become my browser of choice		
38455	Its definitely an excellent browser but I still prefer to use Firefox  Its just what Im used to now		
9390	Facebook is a great tool for professional and personal contact management to keep up with people	Firefox has been my fav browser for years now  Chrome is giving it a run for money on the speed side		
90191	like all these social networks there is a learning curve but Buzz shows great promise still test driving and trying to collapse the overly long threads!		
90194	Google analytics makes me look really smart  Which is quite an accomplishment	It seamlessly works with the rest of my google stuff and the connections are savvy and helpful		
90195	One of the most helpful tools i use	Can be great when you want to keep in touch with friends but can be a perfect tool to waste your time		
34092	Awesome  awesome  awesome	I like it  I like the ad ons  but Ill stick with chrome  its much faster		
10901	The best of the online feed readers  methinks		
2755	OMG TWITTER IS NUMBER ONE!		
1422	One of the greatest creations since the pencil sharpener  Great to review pop culture stuff  Now if it would only add a comics section	Serves its purpose  but dont use it enough  Not sure what the big deal is  Its just email	Its novelty has worn off about 6 months ago  but it still serves a purpose  Good for networking and connecting w/ old friends	Not for the weak of heart  but once you get it  you get it   Great application	Went from like to love   Great site  I want more	Really good source of information from the obscure to the current	Great resource for photo sharing and exploring	Possibly one of the coolest sites ever  So glad this thing exists  Just wish it could get shows online faster	Good  solid app  Fun and easy to use	Its cool & handy  but I honestly dont use it enough often forgetting that I have an account		
1421	Best tool to stay connected on the internet and off the computer	A beautiful way to display your book collection on the internet	Coda is extremely clean and easy to use	One of the best things to hit the web since Twitter  Blippr should be integrated with every site  :)	combines the function of a blog with community extremely well  I love posting my own content as much as reading what others have to say	The best source for all your web addiction needs		
81240	kind cuz i just join try to work things out		
13178	Mashable is in my group great information  Keep it coming		
82573	It could have gone on to greatness  Sad	Made some great friends  Downtime is annoying	Ive had my email account since 2004  Ive never looked back!	If you can email  you can use Posterous  LOVE IT!

60345	Started two weeks ago  Still feeling uncomfortable  Still not knowing how to handle the big amount of extra information

11509	A great Application  see a lot of future with this one		
90318	Great approach at social networking  Needs some improvement  but it is a new service  so Im looking forward for new features it will include in the future

86291	I like twitter  If u want to make money just advertise on twitter http://eCa sh/CC8f		
70723	I think the only reson I like it at this point is because my friends are using it  Otherwise  its become a complete mess of pointless games and quizzes

90311	Amazing ! Best connection with missing friends at every where in our short life period  Lovely !		
39068	Simply and super useful		
90314	Buzz is getting better  and thats a good sign  But it still has a lot of room for improvement  I dont think Google will let it die

11516	A great way to get professional development and news!	A great tool for creating a photo journal	I can hardly wait!

89324	thanks    www facebooklogin gen tr		
86298	I love it more than other Email boxes Its nice and easy to catch but some times Its slow   Its so professional than yahoo or hot mail or any other mail serv		
11513	twitter is so addicting! i joined back in early 2007 and never used it  i though Who would ever do this? apparently millions of people  follow me @tylerdude17		
86295	i love it very very much nice to have some fun even to see those little kids singing theyre such cute with the nice voices		
31107	Incredibly lightweight  and does the job perfectly  Considering how little RAM I have  I love it	Great innovative email service  Huge amounts of space  too	Nice  but kind of clunky and outdated  Twitter has replaced RSS  for me  anyways	Really fun to play around on  and useful as a map as well	Great  but wish more people would use it  Also can be annoying when people take the What I had for breakfast approach  Good replacement for RSS  however		
11512	First time I used it I loved it and thought it is even easy for a new twit like me!!		
44400	One of my favourite linux distros	Beats windows almost every time  many flavours available  and well supported  GO LINUX!	Love it  absolutely fantastic  The best Multi IM Client I have used for a long time	Brilliantly stable  powerful  looks good  fast  Had no problems since I have been BETAing it  Much better than its predecessor (Vista)		
68411	Great search engine and feedback   much better looking than its competitors		
70733	It is a great way to reconnect with friends and family     But  the damned games and farms and fish and diners are driving me crazy!!!		
64057	because there are many information i needs to know		
91678	How to download YouTube videos (including HD videos) ?  YouTube Download program for all free users   http://www youtube downloads 110mb com/  How big it		
40048	i finally found something goodand free  thanks! lets get blipping!		
77374	Definitely at the forefront of The Social Evolution		
76043	Well  its only problem is that it really eats up the system memory after some time  and goes slow with that  It really should have many processes  like chrome		
52074	Im adicted to facebook its my fav!		
77377	Easy to customize theme  awesome functionality  and slick features make this my favorite twitter client	Best browser  the one I use the most  Cant beat the addons!	Totally awesome  one of the things I do the most	Great for sharing photos	Its awesome  but for some reason I love Tumblr waayy more		
12818	Great money management tool for the every person  Manage your finances through the web or through your iPhone		
1476	I use gmail and google hosted email for my domains   What I like best is the mobile integration and the ability to get ALL my Google stuff on my iPhone		
91668	Im so addicted to facebook  Im on it 24 7 like yea!		
5836	The best option for watching and uploading HD and a nice change from all the dross on YouTube	At last  a method of statistically proving my music taste is superior to your music taste	Great  but has the downside of clogging up your system the longer you use it	Really? Does it need to be explained why Google is so great?	Throw away your phone  its redundant	Its getting there  but perhaps feels a bit stale   Spotlight search is the best though	As much as I like its utility  I am also often furious at it for its shortcomings	Future of the music industry? Probably not  but useful    especially when youre drunk and have to find this one song	Gets a very bad rep  but works fine for many peoples basic browsing needs  The security holes do need to be fixed however	Good lord  this thing is consuming me		
64052	I luv it so much  This is wonderful experience to meet so many people in the world		
68422	Its basically the new God

1492	It is a good and stable browser   Not perfect but what browser is?	Come on Google is like the blood of the internet   How doesnt like it ?	Really the best torrent client for windows as I remember it :D	Who doesnt like Facebook ?? Isnt everyone on it no matter if you like it or not ?	This is my primary Email client    wouldnt live with out it :D

5849	seems awfully bloated but hey gotta synch my Ipod	dont use it as much as blip fm right now but might later	has considerable limitations at present	dont use it as much as one might think I would  use Google Maps online much more	good is getting better	alternately wonderful and annoying as hell	every time a feed breaks it spits it out and the feed has 2 b readded  annoying amount of babysitting	helps make the machine work better	one of the best things about the internet	kinda weird and limited	my 1st string browser   crashes and is a mem hog at times tho	some of it is sort of Vader tho	good is getting better   the horrendous display quality of some of it is annoying	it works well enough for when I need a torrent proggie which is not everyday		
32412	 OH THIS COOL YEH YOU GOT THE RIGHT STUFF GIVE IT TO ME BABY   NOW TALKING OH OH I JUST BLIPPED MY SELF  EXCUSE ME!		
78699	much better than baidu	fresh and simple  especialli no adds		
1488	Google Wave  is a revolutionary way of communicating  But its no replacement for Email  Its far from it  Currently Wave is just another new Social Network	Alongside TechCrunch  Mashable is up there in my top blogs to read  Its great for finding new information on some of your favorite social networks		
12828	I have approx 550 feeds and i love that I can tag feeds of interest and add sites to my RSS notes which use the same tags Its the ultimate tool for web research		
90328	Tendulkar is very great personality &such abig guy		
12822	Really easy and simple to use	Seamless cross platform  cross browser  multi workstation file sharing		
65393	thanks twitter 4 giving me apportunity to join with new friends		
94721	The best of anything you could ever think of  Useful  respectful  trendy  geeky  mobile    and the list goes on!		
90363	Talks about subjects that other people dont want or prefer us not to talk about  I appreciate the nice clean subjects  Nothing crude  either  Even corp s don		
91693	The best gift in the history of gift giving!!!! Love it  How did i ever live without it		
70750	Google buzz same as twitter	Follow me on twitter:  http://www twitter com/apurvgourav		
67107	Gmail is amazing     I use it for everything    literally		
90366	use it everyday :)		
77391	Most practical app to manage and organize RSS feeds !		
45719	It is the technology that will refine the telegraphic abilities of our brain and the receptors in our cells in ways we cannot even imagine yet    It is Amazing!		
77394	Endless entertainment and information		
76063	Ok  I used to totally love it  Now that I guess myspace bought it  it  SUCKS  I guess Ill find another music/video site that has not sold out to myspace		
77398	only had it for 24 hours and its very sleak  Only gripe so far is that I need to attach it to my PC and dont see the seemless cloud connectivity to gmail	Excellent for projects and collaboration where teams are distributed indifferent cities and contintents  Finding it difficult to convert some people tho	I have an andriod phone for over 1year & it just gets better Just yesterday  i purchased an iphone so that i can compare them  iPhone is great but Android smart		
77399	I just want to say goodbye to the Windows world  and Google looks likely to help me do that  I will never forgive Microsoft for the pile of s***t called Vista

69760	I love google wave i can manage my project on it with my colleagues

68444	Firefox is a very fast browser  is supporting neat all sorts of programming languages and works on every operating system very good  Its just the best browser		
70767	youtube is on of the best websites ever!		
45701	Super fast  simple UI  in my opinion an amazing browser  which is only lacking in plug in support		
91683	Checking out the Blippr Review pluggin		
91689	Better organized and faster than Hotmail  Prefer it over any other email hosting company	The only video site I use  because its got videos for just about anything		
90358	the most entertaining website!! all of us would have been so deprived without it!	Cant imagine life without without gmail!!		
5873	Twitter gets a lot of my attention	Gluing content together from the fragmented Social Media scene is important for #lifestreaming   FriendFeed com makes that easy  Just needs duplicate detection!		
90357	its just so easy to use  but it would be nice to be able to use lists  because now its not very clear with all the posts in one big list		
56461	FB stay connected with friends and watch those people you never really liked try to be your friends		
40015	i use google in daily conversation    its become a part of our culture		
90350	Great news and comment  and some great functionality  Especially love ncluds new Mashable app  although some sort of mashable:// URL would be nice!		
3208	My favorite twitter client for the desktop	Plays almost everything without the need for codecs and stuff	Very simple solution for remembering things on the web you want to check out later	No nonsense full featured music player for Windows	Great open source vector graphics editor  good alternative for Ilustrator	Transparent file sync  backup and sharing solution  Comes with 2Gb free	Great webbased messenger  supports msn  gtalk  yahoo  icq etc  Now with a cool iphone app to make it even better!	Keep your text/audio/video notes everywhere  Has web  desktop and iphone clients	Prefer this over Twinkle and Twitterfon  even if its a payed app	Twitter seems to be really taking off   Like it because it is (still) so simple and basic		
55135	i want to join with twitter		
81401	The new CV creator is just great !		
30694	Best browser out there so far  I wish Safari would learn from them		
12804	My favorite comment system but I maybe slightly bias   heh		
30690	Started out sceptical using Twitter  but can say now that I am addicted to it  As Mickey D would say loving it		
55138	its mah first tym so lets see		
56465	its just great  info in the moment!		
90348	love it  its new and does need lots of work but im positive google will work out all the issues it has and make it a major player		
88038	Very easy in use  functional no extra flashy things  Like it a lot	Very interesting and educational  latest reviews  news etc for me personally the best social media blog	Love it and totally addicted to it  Fortunatly I have to use it at work ;)

88065	I LIKE IT BECAUSE EVERYTIME A NEW SONG CUMS OUT ITS ON THERE AND U CAN LEARN DANCES		
5881	Its hard to tell right now  but the integration of several services in one place is potentially useful  I still post more Twitter updates than Buzz ones though		
40002	Lean and mean  Fast and sprightly  Well done  Google	About the only Reader that works really well  Google does it better than anyone else  Except havent found how to rename Labels  Strange blip	I trust Mashable for my Web 2 0 and social technologies news  Although it does not work well with my Firefox  hrmpph		
94746	One of the greatest think tank in the world		
90388	Interesting  powerful but messy (UI & all the stuff that has been discussed since the release)		
56473	isnt it fascinating  thats what we need from time to time		
82758	I used it a week  but seemed one of not that many    Twitter  facebook are simply too popular    Twitter already location aware and facebook will follow  march		
61822	Twitter   my fav place to go  when in depressed!		
82759	yup   while it was not fighting with my phishing filter it was great		
81437	another fantastic Tool from my beloved Google  Tkank You :D

8903	Im chatting with Pete Cashmore now and he suggested I check out blippr   Im going to rate Twitter  b/c obviously  I think its awesome		
43983	What can I ask more from Gmail  The best e mail around without a doubt	Excellent is all what I can say about this  :)		
94731	My tech bible :)		
68466	Windows 7 an improvement on Vista which caused me no end of pain since its release  The hibernation works properly too  Still prefer OSX for my primary machine	The Google Wave preview takes a little getting used to  It will only come into its own when the floodgates open and everyone you know/work/share has access		
8920	I love GMail  But I think there is so much more that Google should do with mail  Google just is not cutting edge anymore	Just love it  I hardly ever did forward funny or interesting e mail to friends  I now forward my picks to my posterous	Twitter has become a commodity for some of us  Nevertheless  I think  should Facebook get better  it might be able to render twitter obsolete		
70782	Functionality is great however somewhat limiting on layouts   I also dont like that its not integrated with AdSense  however integration in general is very good		
89380	I love the games & being able to connect with old & new friends alike  I keep UTD w/current events & learn about new things  All around a great site		
43980	I have something to read thanks to the useful people I follow  Its always interesting to have news on tech world in an efficient  filtered and workless way  :)		
42656	Love it & love it more now that theres a Blackberry app for it	Nice app & social tool for managing Twitter & Facebook  Some nifty extras as well	Missed the start of the new season of Hells Kitchen Caught up on Hulu  Its free; its great	Whats not to love? Its fast replacing following blogs for me  And allows virtual attendance of conferences	Cool way to browse your pics; the 3D view/scroll is smart  Some nice GUI features too  Like it  although non essential in the grand scheme of things

8925	Since i found the watch there i have been looking for   Love the way it looks  moves and tweets about stuff		
88880	Best OS from Microsoft so far	Fast browser with support for latest technologies  No longer supports some widely used technologies though		
80907	Firefox blows goatz		
48854	Firefox made me switch from what was then my favourite browser   IE  How little I knew	Its great  but its become so bloated in the past few versions that I tend to only use it now as a last resort  I dont need links  uploads  templates etc	Some way to go before its considered good    Its fast  but its CPU/memory footprint leaves a lot to be desired	Love it  Much better than the iPhone	I resisted it for so long and now I wonder why	Great  but clunky  Would like to see Facebook style photo layout (click for next etc) and more space for free accounts		
11591	First app Ive ever actually paid for   Love that it handles my multiple twitter accounts		
8941	Its really hit the mainstream media recently  I use it to find out and echo topics of interest to my professional life  Its been great so far		
10260	Great software even in beta! TweetDeck gives Twitter an IM like interface with alerts and a slew of features including translating tweets!		
67954	Works well  most of the complaints I see from people areOMG IT IS DIFFERENT FROM XP! and WHY DOESNT IT WORK ON THIS OLD COMPUTER? but it works fine	One of the Best apps out there  And deffinatily the best im client	Kicks firefoxs ass	Works good  many platforms nothing else will work on		
11590	Brilliant  Im not saying its better than Google  but perhaps better than Google News (/any other news website)  :)		
47520	Unlike Myspace  Facebook is populated largely by people who go by their real names  Its great getting back in touch with old classmates  coworkers  and friends

86218	like their shares moved a lot in the right direction  north ^		
11595	The idea is great  Problem is  noone I know is using it  So for me  its just a comment system that works pretty much just like any other  Shame	Keeping track of all my songs for new and interesting music recommendations  or listening to my library when I am away is real nice	The browser of choice on my Mac  Despite everything  no other browser can match safari when Im on my home turf	Now if I could only keep up a blog for longer than two weeks	So ubiquitous  I just cant imagine my life without it anymore	The best way to share pictures online! The groups dont work at all the way I would like them  but as a photo sharing site  pretty much unbeatable!	I wish I had photographed myself when realizing this wasnt just about the web apps    Books  games  movies  music    This is soooo awesome!	This is my brain on super strong  knowledge increasing  free from all sideeffects except the addiction drugs  Any questions?	The problem with relaying social network information is duplicates  so its less of a fit for me since I started twittering in addition to facebook	I just dont read RSS like I used to    But if I were  google reader would be where I would be doing it!	Not accessible enough  though    I never remember to go there  Good for killing a couple of hours  though!	Google might be king of search  but whenever I need movie info  this is the place to go	I tried to stay away for a long time    But I finally got it  Like the new facebook stream  only more alive!	Another all pervasive service  Too bad the social networking functions totally sucks	The first webmail client I use over a desktop version  I miss a native iPhone app to be able to use tags in a more intuitive way  though	Its a great way of keeping track of what friends and acquaintances are doing  but at the expense of a multitude of really crappy apps inside		
36872	Informative  A reliable source for the latest innovations and trends in social media		
15953	Great people can buzz you on your mobile  without the app even being opened	Its my media center of choice now  just wish it didnt crash so much !	But the whole music thing is such a commodity  There are a zillion ways to be close to music  but the quality of music being put out leaves much to be desired :	But I havent devoted time to become adept with it	Went crazy at the start trying to get it via proxy  Now Miro has filled the void for the most part	More indispensable by the day  but they need to offer a client for S60 devices :( Nokia outsell the #2 and #3 cell phone makers combined FFS!		
44492	Best collection of high production and commercial video available free on the internet  but unfortunately most of it isnt viewable outside of the United State		
88875	Twitter is an objective proof that the world is flat  Few words  learning to get to the point		
8932	Can do a lot and if not  there is a plugin that can  Great stuff		
8933	@tweetdeck : The best Twitter app available  Cross platform too  which is nice  If only it could handle multiple accounts	After two years of use Twitter has become one of my most important tools for communication  A great place to share ideas	The best web based email Ive ever used and an integral part of my daily life		
11596	not microsoft  what else do I need to say?

67964	Its a perfect sites for social networking  Having new interrelationship with different kinds of people		
12891	I chose Seesmic especially for its powerful multiple account management  Great tool!	I checked out a lot of blogging tools  but they just dont manage to catch up with the latest trends like WP  Besides the user interface is just great	Really simple and a lot of choice to give your Twitter page your own look and feel	In my opinion the best Twitter client for iPhone	Before I thought it was useless  Now I know Twitter is a good way to stay in touch with people you know  to meet new friends and to gain/share knowledge		
8950	Best app ever! :)	Coolest app after gmail! OK  lets sfeed some stuff now :)

31175	Fast  extendable  easy to use  Just the best browser IMHO	I use Wikipedia every day  amazing how many different and obscure topics it has information on	Tooth meltingly fast  great for social networking and keeping up to date with feeds and news  Flock has now replaced Firefox as my favourite browser	Great site for the latest news on Twitter and other social networking sites  always useful  always informative  always up to date	Chrome is in its infancy  and as such  I cant really judge  but it is bite the back of your hand fast  just needs the extendability of FF	Great service  literally expanded my music knowledge hundredfold  Found loads of artists I never knew before  great recommendations	Great comprehensive music library  fast streaming  easy to share playlists  The best streaming app available		
31174	i wish they would adopt some of chromes design (button positioning a lot better with chrome)	love it  getting better everyday

668	The best BitTorrent client Ive found  Clean UI  easy to use  very configurable  and tiny to boot	Digsby has replaced Trillian  Pidgin  and all other IM clients for me  Its easy to use and very feature rich	Not a bad little browser  and its got an interesting architecture  Not perfect  though; I still prefer Firefox and its flexibility	I think Vista has gotten a bit of a bum rap  Ive never had any real problems with it  UAC takes a bit of getting used to  but overall Vista is a good OS	Not the end all be all of social networks that its sometimes claimed to be  but still useful for keeping tabs on distant acquaintances

Lovely interfaces and dead simple theming system  Really addicting too	I hope it doesnt spread itself too thin across too many things

31907	it helps to connect with friends		
79093	twitpic is ugly  but effective  I like the commercials sometimes

76815	Facebook is the best way to connect everything friends  bussiness  etc		
6374	You can build any type of site with this thing and all its plug ins	Instant fun: Twitter for movies  games  apps  and music	One of the best sites on the web  I havent had cable for two years because of YouTube :) Now  if I could just find the repeat playback option	Lightweight but powerful  If youre torrenting anything  use this	I could spend all day on Flickr  If you like artwork and photography  you really havent lived until youve been here	A great service that reminds me of the old music module sites of yore but brought up to date  Now if I could just find out why it stopped working with Amarok	A good web app with plenty of features  One of the few that doesnt cater only to singles	Still one of the best social networking sites  Not for the friends  but for the music  Listen to almost any band and discover new songs  Awesome	Neat  but needs to be more available on 3rd party services before I use it daily  It was nice to use it in a classroom environment  though		
75502	love meeting people

9402	i love all the free add ons		
35495	Only IE has that adorable AND NOT IRRITATING *chink* sound on every link click!		
83139	Eerily good at picking out tracks and artists that I like  Love the statistics it provides  Scrobble me happy	I remember gleefully turning to a random page in my old World Book Encyclopedia when I was a kid  I get that same joy from Wikipedia today	I prefer this to Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes  for instance  since I can see my friends ratings  Really like the Web 2 0 features of the site  too	Twitter in principle might be more interesting than Twitter in practice; plus whats with the 140 character limit ;)?	Lighweight AND feature rich? How often does that happen	Until I get my own helicopter  Google Maps satellite view will do nicely		
40837	It gives me the best results  the most relevant results  the quickest results of all search engines		
52872	Google  will take over the world  I like  I hope Google destroy corrupted politicians!

84469	el balor q tenemos delante de dios es lo q nos db dar fuersa para segir adelante		
10198	The best email in the world  What more you want to know?	Been using this for nearly two years? Perfect for searching for specific things without caring which site you end up at   and then keeping them!	Its not the best and its got too much to it   but it works well and is popular  so its ok	Being able to get my most used files from anywhere via the iPhone or any PC is brilliant  And so simple  A+	Feature packed yet feels lightweight  Beautiful app from Seesmic	I love it and I cant really explain why  I can see its potential but havent tapped it yet	It has its uses  but comes with WAY too much rubbish	Fast  beautiful to look at and would be my preference   IF they ironed out compatibility issues (XStandard eg) and IF it had plugins	Still my go to when looking for all round functionality  Some are catching it up (Seesmic!) but not quite there yet		
14555	use the portable version and avoid all the extras   great for its social media integration with IMs	simply the best browser for all the addons

14560	Handy little icon in corner of browser updates tweets every 5 10mins or so which can mean I do nothing but read tweets Could do with following list		
63532	we are into trading of software both English and Mathematics  Also we are into selling of church organ  Therefore i think great

50222	nth imp jus likd that!		
85787	As someone whos not comfy with face to face interactions  I loved how FB helped me break the ice among my colleagues by sharing snarks and jokes  :)	Name it  VLC plays it  Minor quibble: could use some pretty fying  interface wise	My go to site for quick infos   assignments  celeb bios  comparison of apps features  rumored devs  movie summaries/spoilers  etc  Beware of grammar potholes	It was love @ 1st sight when it loaded my FB games effortlessly  Now I cant browse online without it! I love the speed and its omnibar!		
13236	awesome for tweeting! Lives happily in the background without making me feel smothered with tweets  Icon could NOT be cuter!	OMG its an online service for information packrats like ME!

43099	I cant believe I didnt find this before  I dont know where I was when BJ Thomas was at the top of his game I guess they didnt show videos then like now		
9423	Use it for sharing sites with friends  not so much for tagging itself		
95134	Very nice  gets the job done when it comes to getting the word out   How fun it is also really depends on who you follow   Open APIs is excellent too	Its ok  it needs to have a lot more content to be excellent though   I really appreciate the convenience  but what I want to watch is never on there	Dropbox is one of the most fantastic pieces of online software that i have found   No flash drive? No problem  use Dropbox	TweetDeck is AWESOME!  The iPhone/iPod version has some bugs and the Facebook connectivity needs some UI help but other than that    GREAT!	I <3 Gmail   Works well on every platform Ive used it  tons of room and lots of connectivity   Whats not to like?	Who doesnt like YouTube?  Yeah  theres a lot of crap on it  and it can be glitchy  but if your subscribed to the right people  can be a good way to burn time		
71163	I get to follow my friends  and they get to follow me with only one post instead of separate emails or massages to each  We can always send DMs too  =D

51566	Wonderfully useful! I follow Mashable on Twitter and check the blog at least once a day for reviews  news and really helpful lists	Most useful Twitter app because it has so many options   searches  directory  customized columns and more  Only thing lacking: ability to schedule tweets		
13202	Easy to pull in various IM accounts and social networking tools  Runs a little slow  but simplifies my life	Better than other Twitter apps Ive tried  but I havent really pushed it yet  Only 1 account and dont use the favorites feature		
48781	This is the application that will change my world		
38504	Chromes become my default browser on my Windows machines  I love the minimalist design  I just wish theyd make Mac and Linux versions already	Its great  As simple or as complex as you want		
10181	You can come out with new versions of all the other browsers  but unless you make it as extensible as Firefox  it wont make me switch		
63550	chat to people ill miss		
15872	It took a little bit to understand how to really use it  but Twitter is great with the right Twitter app

My favorite blog  it has to be included in my daily reads	Evernote is the best for saving any type of notes  pictures  websites!	It is one of my main sources for new software and keeping up with what is going on	I love the service  but the selection of movies to watch instantly is modest  But I have found some very good ones on it  As they add more movies I will use it		
10182	Its a shame that its being overrun with spam  Its making me like Craigslist less and less  but it still has a place in my heart	Pretty friggen awesome	If only I had come up with such a great idea	Hulu    interfering with my productivity since 2007	I dont use it anymore  but its okay  Not my favorite	I love the recommended music station	Vimeo is the YouTube for respectful  creative  serious users  Love it

83145	Its a great IM client but it needs a light version so it doesnt consume CPU  Also  with some accounts  they then to have connection fails	As much as I like playing Mafia Wars  that pretty much sums it up  That was funny		
15873	I use the Tweetie application for my iPhone   quick  light and easy		
9428	Like Firefox but using Chrome 95% of the time now because its so much faster		
14548	The extendability of Firefox makes it the only way to browse	Really great  especially when its free  Its really great for catching up on your overnight tweets

8124	Okay  so it IS better than IE   My loyal heart hates me  but switching was sooooo easy	The perfectly pleasing last round peg to fit in the pathetically square hole of all the R ending sites   This one is the best!  Now  media  feel my wrath!		
9455	its simply amazing how easy it is when it comes to sharing interesting links and ideas about them

9458	Probably the most stable and most popular lifestreaming service Ive tried  Others like Plaxo  Second Brain  retaggr  profilactic cover more services though	My favourite social bookmarking tool  Archives pages  full text search of pages  annotation features  The best !		
10160	I used to use this a lot but Firefox just hits all the right buttons for me	Lots of storage  great functionality! Needs a facelift though	Looks great  i saw the Google Wave presentation and it will definately change the way we do things	Fantastic! I use many Google apps	A poor mans Photoshop  I use it al the time :)	Good  but i prefer Seesmic Desktop		
10163	Very simple  very nice  I cant tweet without it  Brings out that old ICQ nostalgia  Perfect for Twitter begginers	Firefox  with all those addons  is so damn cool  Its the Gmail of browsers: before Firefox we were living the stone age of web browsing

50261	I currently have 7 blogs on it  and will probably add more as time goes on! Its easy and its fun  Wish it let me put scripts in it  though!	No other search engine gives me the positive results that Google does! And it has some whimsy   which I really like!

87527	Love having a social app in my gmail   but it needs a few more features and tweaks for me to love it	Excellent product  If you have some irreplaceable photos and documents  Dropbox will keep them safe   and save all your revisions for 30 days!	I love the openess of Android   but it seriously needs an iTunes like media manager  I miss iTunes U from my iPhone alot too	Google Reader is awesome    especially now that it has 2 way commenting via buzz		
31088	Initially  Google Buzz is devoid of all the nonsense that has become a mainstay in twitter  I think the convos and topics are a lot more informative	Ease of use and a clean interface make it a favorite with me!		
84496	I like it so far  HUGE potential  so plenty of room to Love it! in the future	Google owns the world	THE e mail service to use

82663	Hulu has replaced cable and satellite in my house  but Im all about saving so we will see how long this free network remains just that!	I am always telling other about Skype! Everyone in my house has their own account! If you use paypal though  only 1 paypal account per skype account		
30660	I like it  but I like the FriendFeed layout better   No ads  slick interface and better realtime  Facebooks good because so many people use it	Awesome site! Tons of tips for software and everyday life	Really nice interface  clean and awesome real time  But I like FriendFeed better since I can post to Twitter from it and keep all my stuff in one place!	Awesome  open  no closed app store that is subjective	Google Chrome is great! With a larger developer community and a better extension API  this could really take off  By far  one of the best web browsers around!	With time  this could replace email  but it needs time to mature and have a developer community grow before it gains widespread adoption  Best for collaboration

9473	Lots of usefull features google does not have (yet)		
37280	Why web inspector was by default removed when beta ended?	Long live to the king! IE6 die  please  for the web to finnaly move on!	A few improvements needed but 99% is done and really well done  Streaming is so fast!		
8140	Very cool application   I see it becoming more useful as technologies converge over the next decade	I really like the idea and the website works relatively well  but it is cluttered and was a little frustrating to get going	Very cool aggregator of online media   I wish there was a search for a given show/movie across sources	Whoops  got a few NSFW pages while killing time between coding stints	Works fantastically  very polished player  but the number of movies is limited and the search is pretty awful

9481	Rediscovered Last fm again and this time I am not going away :)	I am still exploring it  but I like what I see	Great IM client  I love how it integrates everything I care about in one small window  Interface is really minimalistic and thats the way I like it	I am happy with Evernote  but I wish it allowed me to organize my notes better	I like their interface  but I wish they support RSS for books in my shelf  Their community features could also use some tuning  Its still a great website thou!	I like application and advertising  platforms	Best RSS reader out there  I love their mobile interface	I like their drag and drop support	If you must go with Linux I guess Ubuntu is a good choice	I like their programming section	I used to love Opera  but their support for Ajaxy websites like Google docs  Google Reader made me switch to Firefox	New user here  I love the idea and websites interface  Good job!	I like it (specially the HD option)  but I am not an avid user	Great way to see alternatives to applications you use day in and day out	Sometimes I find myself reading Wikipedia for hours	Post SP1 Vista is very usable  but as many others I am waiting for Windows 7	I miss all Firefox extensions	FIrefoxs greatest feature is its extensions  I do wish it was a little snappier and used a little less resources		
55063	first i loved Chrome  but then it became really annoying   a crush after a crush  and the tabs always want to separate  it just doesnt want to listen to me		
60406	I underestimated what it could do   met people I havent seen in the last 20 years   simply amazing  The apps   really annoying and intrusive		
60416	I start Twitter today and its a very cool Application! I can find very quickly all the last news!		
79036	Twitter is an Excellent tool to help you keep in touch and up to date with the world today!!		
31971	Makes life so much easier if you have several IM accounts  with everything in one place and only 1 app to open (apart from Skype)	Handles multiple Twitter accounts so well and allows Userlists too   essential! This is a really nice app! Full marks!		
31973	Twitter is the Slap Chop of da internet  cute device that lets u hew ur thoughts into 140 char bite size nuggets & RT tasty crumbs 2 ur feather brained followas		
49256	YouTube is a good venue for training like OilPainting examples		
1519	Same here  I love the speed of Chrome and the stability of each tab being its own entity but we needz extensions and add ons like yesterday	The gold standard for blogging  Best of all  free!		
81352	 I like it because its quick and easy to use		
30649	Fast  secure  free and simply works		
68375	I still prefer IE to the rest of the options		
90297	Its a great way to communicate with SHORT messages to a vast audience		
37260	hmm still waiting for an invite		
8165	I still prefer Firefox  and Im waiting for Linux support  but its OK  Each tab and plug in as its own process is a great idea as processors get more cores	Overall  its probably the best browser available  I love how easy it is to add extensions  And it works great on Linux!	Its not completely perfect  but no Operating System is  Hands down its the best  though	Simple  well organized bittorrent client  I use it on Ubuntu	A great example of the potential of open source software  Powerful yet pretty easy to use	The webmail interface is great  but I use my own email client (Evolution) since you can  Free IMAP support is awesome!

68387	Worlds best browser? Sure! Dabbled with Opera (not bad) but keep coming back to the Fox  The add ons should only be used sparingly (I think)	Of the four bookmarking services I have used I keep coming back to delicious  Still the most reliable! Greasemonkey scripts increase its friendliness	An essential tool for me  I actually understand what it does! Make sure you get the updates	Blippr! First time I have actually enjoyed posting anything on the internet  Thanks  Blippr people  Very Much	Still my main feed reader! Not beautiful  But wonderfully practical  fast and configurable  Bloglines has not kept pace at all  Go GR

9495	I hate the new design but I like keeping in touch with my friends	Its much better than Facebook		
90295	Thinking about it    Im sure it will catch on but overtake others? Not sure; but then it IS Google!		
9493	MySpace has amazing surprises once you start exploring it  Facebooks fine  but MySpace keeps improving in tech  I think its growing a bigger audience than ever

8184	I use it mostly for the easy playlist management	I cant decide between Opera or Firefox yet  So far i like the Fox a bit better because of the various add ons	Essential for me  I use it almost every day		
85726	It plays almost every media type out there  great open source player for all platforms!	I use it occasionally  but not very useful for me personally  I like reading tweets from people and organizations Im interested in	Interesting  but I dont see much value in it  Its just an experiment right now	Great  especially for rapidly changing technology info	Good sharing site  useful for pictures I want to share to the whole world  otherwise I use facebook	I really like this browser  but its slow to develop on the Mac  Still waiting for plug in support	My first choice for online mapping  I like the community tagging features and local info	I use it as my personal home page and blog  good simple system  and a good community with lots of plug ins and skins	Its generally better than Internet Explore  but it seems to still seems to use more memory than other browsers	Faster than Firefox  but has compatibility problems with a few sites

A great way to blog!	The best way to keep track of my listening habits  Invaluable!	Great messenger  if not a little limited by its protocol usage	Makes keeping track with friends and family as easy as logging on    and keeps out all that unwanted CSS that Myspace lets through! ;)	Favorite torrenting application  supported by a wide variety of trackers  very fast and efficient    Invaluable for file sharing!	Love it for its social features  but still cant give up its older brother	Well I like Google and all    but the browser is in its infancy as of yet  When it matures a bit more  perhaps it will make me switch from Firefox!	Absolutely  hands down  the greatest email service in existence  And its not even commercial (yet)!	After all these years  still the leader when it comes to finding what you want	Great way to broadcast pretty much anything		
54729	Definitely my favorite torrent program  Lightweight and stable!	I made the change to Gmail a few years ago  and havent looked back once  The interface  the amount of storage   its great!	An app I discovered moments ago  Im already hooked! This will certainly become one of my most frequently visited web sites!	What needs to be said about Firefox? If you use it  you know why its great  If not  you dont know what youre missing	Windows 7 = Like Vista  but better  Love the new taskbar!		
38614	very interesting and keeps u updated in real time		
48890	myspace is like da coolest web site like no one hates it in my whole life one preson has told me myspace was wack		
13336	Love my Android phone  could not love it any more unless it brought me breakfast in bed  And to iPhone fanboys I have one thing to say: concurrent processes	Easiest and most flexible blog platform   bar none		
15999	But Chrome is better  IMO	Fast  fast  fast  fast  fast  faaaaaast  I use it and I like it  When adds comes out  It will pwn Firefox so bad		
47559	Its almost like Google has a hand in every app I use these days  Email  browser  docs  maps  FBs not far behind  These guys want to rule the internets	Eloquence in 140 characters  lots of noise too  you just need to have a little care with the people you choose to follow back	I love it  but I need to use it like any normal person do   limit friends to close friends and family and do my networking in groups and pages		
73009	Still the best news source for web2 0 news	I really like Google Readers simplicity   just wish there was a better mobile version		
73006	*sigh* i cant believe imeem is gone   i had so many favorite playlists		
10270	Evernote is amazing and the free edition is a steal! It can be a light CRM  a brain dump  a GTD tool  a project document collection and much more		
48885	Its kool but sumXs u get bored:=]]		
8236	The most usefull social network		
62356	prolly zi best    but big and scary		
75663	i like and new come to join Twitter		
66719	but I have always problems with updates (themes and plugins stop working)  Is this an eternal BETA process? WTH!		
22250	Testing out Blippr   hope this works	Its making my life a lot easier		
87656	a better tool than twitter	Greatest blog on the net!		
34244	After of 32 000 rankings of over 3 000 titles I am still addicted  Damn I love this site		
88987	pretty nice stuff  great community  Google Picasa is way better	If youre in it  you wont want out	my first twitter client  needsupdates!	Probably the best mobile operating system in the world  Using an iPhone though	by far the best E Mail Service	who could live without it? only thing that sux is that those article writing people think they are the masters of language  and who is not sux	lot of potential  lot of lag  lot of not everyone uses it so i wont too		
15964	I really love it  When i have some issue  They always give me good solution		
10277	Its what Im using now  but theres definitely some awkward niggly issues that need ironing out before I commit to it	Until 2 days ago I used it without question  Now  after a load of crashes  Im looking elsewhere		
43196	Gmail has changed the worled arounf  remember the days when yahoo was giving just 5 mb http://www umeedastrology com		
10276	ideal to share docs between multiple pc/macs and users	a true cool and incredibly usefull application  especially if u use a PC next to your MB		
88983	Tiger Woods ve http://organizebrnckvvtmllttrhaberi blogspot com/ birarada		
14636	Easy to use  Great for posting links to media and stealing stuff off others  See my own page  for instance  (Cool layout   but nicked from someone else)		
38605	I really like firefox  it works really well  has a ton of cool apps like firebug and is really customizable		
10280	I adore Last fm  I really do  Now  if I could figure out a way to get it to scrobble songs from Pandora  Id be set	I use TweetDeck for my main account  but I still swear by Twhirl for the ability to access more than one Twitter account at once  (Plus Seesmic!)	Ive been on a lot of blogging platforms for the long term  and tried even more  Xanga is different because it rocks the community aspect more than the others	Probably the biggest site for videos  but its becoming harder and harder to find videos that havent been taken down for one reason or another	TweetDeck is awesome  Its the application I go to for my main Twitter account  I had to use something else for two days and realized how much I depend on it	Seems to have changed quite a bit since it hit mainstream and everyone jumped the bandwagon  but change doesnt have to be bad  does it? Ill wait and see	Its easy to use  and works with Last fm	I dont use it as much as I use FF  but I havent ever had any major problems with it	Microblogging in video form! I dont use it as often as Id like  because the lighting in here isnt that great at night  and I dont have a camera when Im out	Used to love it  but with all the changes  Im liking it less and less	When it comes to multiprotocol messengers for OS X  I swear by Adium  I had to thank my friend profusely for telling me about it	I love Pandora  Adore it  Its sad that it doesnt seem to work outside the US anymore  because it is awesome	Of all the photo sites I use  Flickr is by far my favorite		
63693	hi             friend i am umesh chandra rao		
48875	Keeps me current with my circle of friends

27953	Extremely handy when trying to find your way in a foreign city		
96596	Ive used Mashable for Social Media research and it is INVALUABLE!		
34230	Voting on movies is a no brainer  Already addicted and struggle to pull myself away  Cant imagine when the site is enhanced and more movies are added		
26626	I used to love it  until all the send me this and super throw that started  Now it just seems like more games and ads than anything else	Simple  to the point  put your ideas out there and listen to others  If you have good content  people follow you  Simple  until @oprah showed up that is	Web 2 0 is still a vast tundra of possibilities in so many ways and while we are all still figuring it out  Mashable is happily our personal Tenzing Norgay	I dont dislike it  but it might just be my user ignorance in that its basically just another app that overlaps  You just pick your fave to use		
87649	Lots of good features		
39929	It keep life going and running		
86317	twitter is cool but i dont understand how you make money on it   HELP!

87643	Nice tool with great feature		
53416	I am not a real fan of Facebook  so alternatives are always good  Buzz a but confusing & slow for now  but it has a good prospect to grow	Its my chat client  twitter client  facebook client and all my social networks client  Really amazing creation  Cant live without it  Get it you wont regret!		
87644	Wow  Cool one :)		
87641	Very cool service that complements Twitter		
10288	Loving it  Before I tried thwirl and tweetdeck  but somehow did not work for me  DestroyTwitter does  And off course created my own theme very easily		
83281	It is evil in sense  but God its addicting ;)		
36082	Tried Chrome  love Firefox  constant updates from a loving community  Whats not to love		
88085	Best email client	Google is my favorite company		
67144	Its the most simplest and easy to use blogging platform  Also there is so much more a non designer  non technical person can do with blogger than others		
92100	Needs more love  not as bad as they say		
93438	please invite me (amanda orangejeruk@gmail com) thanks   :)		
40101	Love this photo site  Easily my favorite thus far	Recently found this blog  has some fun stuff on it  A good one to check out	Be smart about how you use it and its an awesome resource  Great place to get some quick info	Extremely useful  I always find myself checking up on actors and films  Great resource	I could watch the HD videos all day long	Reliable  I really dont have any complaints  Might not be the most feature packed complex app  but works well for me	So awesome  And makes planning trips fun!	Super easy to use  Good design  only if it worked right all the time		
15144	Great browser  The add ons are nice  however it takes up a load of memory	Holy crap this place is addictive!		
93436	cool image search!!		
15143	Just started using Blippr quite like it		
70792	I dont know  I have mixed feelings about Twitter  Its fun and stuff  but I dont like the hype around it	Gmail is fresh  I love its simplicity and its easy to use  Im still figuring out some cool stuff about it today!		
59520	HEY GUYZ IM NEW HERE		
61842	fast  responsive  and works like a browser should work!		
36086	I like Firefox  because it is safer  faster  and has more current updates than I E  8		
48060	Anyone know How I can add a blog to my website www potgieterfamily co za		
29783	imeem is the place to find music of any style!!!		
29782	WAOO COOL xXD

Have a soft spot of this googlemaps    Many features are updates and useful for searching	Excellent! Awesome! Terrific! Speechless! Its better n faster than window		
30786	Its so relevant to the new economy;a real must for savvy marketers & advertisers promoting products  services  and thought streams		
48062	Currently really neat in my opinion	Been using Firefox for about four years  Love it and the competition its encouraged in the browser world	Its pretty good  Paving the way for more TV to end up on the Internet where it belongs  =)		
30788	Love that columns sync between this & desktop over air; wish sync kept track of whats been read though  Anyone figure out a way to do this?		
67158	No black background! It comes on too hard  Seesmic is mild and nice		
67155	Evernote makes my various computer sessions   at home  work or university   on a desktop  laptop or iPhone   and with or without internet access   all connecte		
72502	Awesome simple project management tool for freelancing  even includes invoicing!		
8265	kind of unorganized  wish it had a search like twitter	Extensions    need I say more? Also  anything is better than IE		
41421	Great search  great company  great services   Google apps for your domain is my saviour	Best email service  period		
15155	Awesome   Got me social	The bestest  awesome  free  inventive		
9599	Tweetie is my favorite Twitter app for the iPhone  It loads quickly and the interface looks great  Im hoping the next update supports groups	I like the concept of Friendfeed however  I dont check the site very often  *shrug* I primarily use it to tweet shared articles from google reader		
93425	hope it wont become a bluff	one of the greatest concepts evr		
73830	the best application ive ever seen !		
55171	Very useful tool both for computer and mobile use		
76093	Great interface  Great functionality	Best alternative to Photoshop		
36075	Awesome way to find new artists  Just a shame the play on demand isnt as simple and comprehensive as spotify	Like we have a choice ; ) On OS X Safari looks great but historically security is sketchy  using Internet Explorer is asking to get hacked  Opera lacks addons		
8262	Like YouTube    but without the 12 year old girl lip syncing Justin Timberlake  Instead  think artists  film makers  and just plain cool people		
9594	I love watching TED with this	the new feature supporting local content is wild		
90391	  Simple chat nice		
76096	It is very light and very efficient  Do not hog CPU resources	i got to say it is the best apps comparing to Skydrive  Love it!!		
60516	I need to learn more about it  I like it so far  and I think it has potential		
30772	been waiting for it all day  love it!		
30771	What about facebook updates? The desktop version does it		
30774	Best Twitter App ever  wished I had an iPhone so I could have TweetDeck everywhere I go!		
29791	lion catch bufffalo		
30773	One more reason to love my iPhone  Ive been using it for twenty minutes and its been great		
81441	I love the new software stack  and it feels more real worldly   finally a MS OS I can sink my teeth into!	Internet Explorer has come a long way and since MS continues to dominate the OS market  its something we need to keep in mind  Not such a necessary evil anymor		
29797	i like <a title=youtube izlesene video izle  videolar href=http://www youtubetc com/>youtube</a> very much		
59534	yeah man   this is good stuff  like eating a phillty steak sandwich mmmmmmmmm good

30776	So far  not bad  I like the UI + functionality  Some hiccups though  Something backend unstable  Also annoyed @ req 4 superlong password  Whats up with that?		
42740	So far the best twitter app	Best music app ever		
92125	I have to find out  This is the first time I see it  So   still unclear www flamingoservicesbonaire colm		
41411	Dont know the reason but I love using this OS		
37397	Cant pass a day without checking it and sometimes spend hours		
37399	Its good for keeping up to date with close friends  Bad because you get bombarded by stupid applications and people you dont like		
36066	CS 3 ist perfect for designing websites but CS 4 sucks badly! The problem ist that CS 4 does not render the fonts like they will be shown in the browsers! FAIL!		
36065	Glitches with GCal oddly enough and other random bugs  Lacks extensions and bookmark syncing    still use it as default for overall speed  may switch to FF 3 5		
92121	oh my fecking god  best thing ever  i am truely addicted  :)		
42746	Aside from the Orwellian overtones and my inability to ignore the similarities between Google and The Borg  of course   I love Google		
55183	I think its funny that we are allowed 160 characters in this field instead of  140 like  twitter  allows : ) Im kidding  Love twitter!		
41416	When will be available on Facebook  or am I not up to date with this bit of news?		
49370	facebook is amazing and i love it sooo i have a question does anyone know a proxy site???		
30760	Created a group  could not add people  nor could I delete the group  Potential is there  not ready for release		
55187	I like orkut a tad better  if only because all my relatives & old friends are there	The fastest  slickest browser to date	Used to be my browser of choice  not anymore  On Chrome since it came out	The newest kid on the block  Rockstar	Couldnt imagine using another Webmail  Have been using it for five years now  still love it as much as I did when I started using it   if not more  Go Gmail!		
30762	Love the UI  Very clever way to display multiple panels of content   Excellent work TD Team!		
1631	Stats are great  I love em	Great  Maybe Chrome is better but at the moment it doesnt offer me anything worth the hassle of getting used to soemthing new		
36069	Google is the heart of the internet	Incredibly powerful & useful social networking tool with minimal interface  Trending topics is one of the best ways online to be up to date with news worldwide	I wish they didnt do the native look for Windows  I used to use Safari specifically to escape Windows  and now it just looks like a native application  Shame	A good social network unfortunately being abused for spam and irritating apps  Still one of the best ways to share any kind of media you like	Although Im a Firefox user  I like to use Chrome a lot  It really is the fastest browser Ive seen  Its very lightweight and it never gets in your way	Mozilla based  fast  functional with the best built in RSS reader Ive seen so far  Very well integrated social networking and media browsing		
48045	 a cool was to show case video

8287	Love it on the PS3! Only have 1 dvd out at a time but its totally worth it!		
15135	i dont have the opportunity to have it but i really thing is very cool	really useful application  i work for all my projects from any computer		
93449	cant not love it    useful    the forum software by the same company is also great: bbpress		
92117	The 10 50 works with most sites  but some of my bookmarklets stopped working		
2980	Their recommendation system is so useful and it runs very smoothly	Just for the concept of collaborative playlists it is a killer app  They know how to make a good interface and collection is growing fast  Then remain the ads		
29779	Greatesy invention since ADHD medication		
79140	Best music social network !		
36055	Great for new web discovery and good conversations

1643	Great browser! Always my first choice  While 3 5 has fixed a lot of the memory leak issues  they still remain  Still a top notch browser	Wonderful service that is a great global communication platform  I use it daily	Good gaming platform that likely demonstrates the future of digital distribution gaming		
30751	Love the interface  Not very stable (crashed 4 time already)  More customization would be nice (bg color  refresh rate)  Good so far  wanting updates soon		
29773	FF iz so damn goooooood!! iloveit!		
48035	Fast and fast is what I want  Wish it could integrate with One Note		
82793	Like it sure  but its ugly and thats no small thing		
30759	Really digging new #Tweetdeck for iPhone/iPod touch  lots of features  Loving the layout		
30756	Its tiny a little hard to read  I first thought I could enlarge columns  Not bad though its useful to perhaps check all my groups quickly  Im mixed		
48030	Mashable is an integral part of my daily news feed	If speed is your thing   its mine   Chrome is the best		
30755	Looks cool and works ok  Crashed once already  not on App Store WiFi yet  Go to desktop Itunes @nonprofitadvice		
8297	Those who founded this site  they are just the best  I just love this site	How can anyone not love Wikipedia?

8291	Web surfing bliss  Scads of add ons for nearly every purpose  Clean  organized and easy to use  Blows every other browser out of the water	Cleaner than MySpace  All of the options and services and such are a bit daunting  Learning the ins and outs is difficult  considering the help is lackluster		
58231	The more you tweet  the more you want to  Its additive		
73860	looks like twitter is experiencing another systemwide crash    thats a shame (

64936	Twitter is a great way to spread the news about neat Web sites I come across  as well as my own news; Also a good source of breaking news!	Introduced to Google in 1999  lovin it ever since  If librarians love it  you know its good  cause librarians are search experts online	Heres where most of the people I know live  Good way to meet other people  through joining groups  and Facebooks suggestions for friends	Makes it easy to post to everywhere!

40240	Its a little complicated but I like it		
67364	A must bookmark site for those who are into social networking and news on all things electronic media	Tired of constant viruses and popups?  Ditch IE  and go with Firefox!  Better browsing  and safer surfing!	A brilliant platform for editing and creating images and media!  Tons of plugins/add ons  and great tools make it simple to use  yet in depth for masters!	This is a great desktop app that allows quick access to your Twitter timeline  as well as providing a fast way to respond	If you use torrents  and havent tried uTorrent  you are missing out   By far the best client out there!	Theres precious little that you cannot find on this user created encyclopedia!	Travel the world while in your pajamas!  Great satellite images combined with 3D models!	Netflix streaming ont he PS3 is great   but the selection of movies that you can watch instantly reads like pages from a B movie catalog   More new releases plz	A great tool for cleaning up your PC   I cleared over a gig with one use!

55382	I like Trendero because it lets me know what others are doing in different countries		
55388	When I first signed on a few years ago  it took 6 months for me to get my first piece of spam mail  Whats not to love?		
78024	My new telephone number =)  Free SMS  voicemail handling  voicemail transcripts  record calls  integrates with Google contacts from Gmail  rings multiple phones	Firefox is a good  but not great web browser   What it has on every other application (presently) is ubiquitous extensibility: all kinds of add ins	Great core marketplace  always competitive prices  very wide selection   Other vendors are exposed here as well  so the selection is vast   Prime rocks	Picasa does photo management right   Facial recognition  upload to the web  Facebook integration  a nice slideshow and standlone viewe  crossplatform!	Chrome is sweet   Its technically innovative  has a clean minimalist profile  and is beginning to implement Firefox like extensions	One stop shop for RSS reading   Ability to like  to share  to post to other services  to comment  and to email RSS items  Unable to deal with secure RSS feeds	Gmail is great   A clean interface  integration with other google services  ability to pull email in from disparate sources  excellent search capability	Ad supported network TV  streamed for free over the internet in 480p   Vast catalog; turns the internet into your DVR   Only 2 minutes of ads for an hour show	Nice and light  integrated support for RSS   Weak regex syntax   No extensibility   Mine completely stopped working  so I migrated to Vuze and am much happier		
59746	Use it every day! Didnt take long for me to upgrade  Connected to 4 computers already!!		
32621	I really love it   I use PS CS4 almost every day	I love Mac OS  i think much better then Windows		
28594	The best browser in the world by far  makes you wonder what the hell Microsoft have doing all these years		
80342	Ad Blocker Plus  Nuff said	Switched from Windows    Like night and day  How do people put up with Microsoft?		
80341	i love it get to find long lost friends		
67362	By far the best email client out there	Ive used it almost everyday for the last 10 years		
33957	So far good  just getting used to using it  Added to email contacts & can send notes via Twitter 2  Just have to remember to check it now & then   Worth a try	I use yelp ALL the time 2 find restaurants or to decide what Im in the mood 4  The reviews have been very helpful & it even gives phone # & directions	So far Im loving blippr but more of my friends need to join AND they need an iPhone app!		
32626	Wow! This will really revolutionize how we communicate through various mediums ranging from emails to blogs  Cant wait!	This is quite interesting  For freelance designers		
88296	Its free  Its fast  You can personalize it as you want with a lot of addons  Its also safe  The best browser Ive ever seen ;)	Lovely blog  a lot of up to date information and all very useful  Id like to have it in Italian  but its perfect anyway		
67378	witter is a service for friends  family  and co workers to communicate and stay connected through the exchange of quick  frequent answers to one simple question		
42896	Great idea! but wish the site would be more mobile friendly and work on more browsers by displaying correctly	good but like most of googles things its over hyped and i think wont be of use to a mass market	Been using it since alpha stage amazing its really developed with plug ins and added functionality	Great free alternative to photoshop and its free but its much harder to learn and not very friendly	Gmail totally changed the way i and many of my friends email  By far the best free email out there	really good way of displaying info and really like the 3d effects thou its fun not useful to me		
92314	I could use a bit more organization like Buzz	Gmail is the best organizes easiest to use email on the internet   High Storage space  great add ins  and more ideas coming all the time   Why use any other?	Nothing better than Google as search or as a Tech company	The only site I visit everyday besides gmail	I am a heavy Android user and love its openness as opposed to certain other big tech companies	It is too convenient not to love  especially for Google addicts		
41566	im new to it but heard a lot about this  at this time i just like  maybe after sumtime il love it		
80337	Lawl  Blippr review on Blippr  Creative  Anywhoo  I just started using it today    I enjoy it	I prefer Uncyclopedia  but Wikipedia has helped me keep my I know random trivial things status :3

78019	almost any topic you can think of  easy to read and comprehend  What a great effort		
78018	Great tool and I like the ethos behind it  Only would say that some of the information can be unreliable	Spend pretty much every waking hour on this site and have learnt so much from people on it		
92308	I like youtube because i had learnedfrom it		
32619	A whole extra 20 characters  Whatever shall I do with them? :) As Ive read that no one is reading my tweets  it doesnt matter what I say here		
869	Best email web client out there	Couldnt (okay  wouldnt *want* to) do web development without it		
33948	I tkink that Posterous is perfect    I can to organize my schedule (times) and for publishing only I need one mail	It is marvelous    I like the aggregators	I always think about Myspace how one site with wrongs about design  but I see some beautiful profiles and so    people prefer it    where is the fail?	Twitter is god between the social media	I love this aggregator  but I need time for concluding   it is very new for me    but now is amazing!	I like it  but I dont understand how combines with my other blogs and apps    no yet	I love it always    Twitter help me to contact people around the world for talk on any theme    it counts!	It has all the information of my interests now about social media    and more	Nutshellmail is real useful    tout le temp!	I could say that I love it    but I use a few    so few    that I dont have enough words because the experience is minim    I think it required time  many time		
45116	Streamlining workflow   thats a big deal		
45115	Not sure about it becoming more Twitter and FriendFeed like	Functional if the interface is still a bit clunky		
47778	yooooo thiz 4 all my haterz fuck yall  u dont like it deal with it		
46442	All people are there  and permit to know more things about your friends

While other map sites just sat there  Google took maps to the next level  Ill never forget the first time I saw Street View  Still amazing!	Pandora is what the Internet should be all about  giving each user exactly what they want	Quite possibly the best online disk service ever  Its so seamless I forget that its in the cloud  A must for iPhone users too!	Really makes you think differently on how people connect and share information	I dont know how I logged into websites before this program  Developers are constantly improving it too!	How could you not love being able to explore the world?	Hands down the most sexy Twitter client out there!	I cant imagine using another CMS for my site  Easy  flexible and beautiful  Perfect for us web designers	Now I just need to convince my friends that a polished UI/UX is more important than being The Mayor of somewhere		
2159	I still remember when there were all those search engines  and someone recommended Google to me  Today  who uses anything else?	Overall  it is very good  better than IE  but ties up too much memory  Has its share of issues with Vista  both 32 and 64 bit

66886	i found this new innovation of my life		
42054	this is the coolest site ever! lovin it!!!		
65556	great music site!		
30071	It would be great if there was a like option  I dont always like to Retweet or reply if I like a post I read		
30073	Great tool! I learned and communicated a ton with it		
30072	Twitter is a really great micro blogging site  They need to catch up to some of the 3rd party developers though  The Twitter homepage is almost obsolete		
33105	I just started using Twitter a few weeks ago and Im hooked  my emails are piling up  my website remains unfinished  maybe I should change the theme to Twitter!		
35767	http://piodalcin wordpress com/ my blog	twitter  makes the verb to tweet legitimate grammar		
35765	It makes it so easy to consolidate all the things I find interesting that I run across out there		
94093	I use it every day to post links and keep in touch with friends	Downloaded the code from wordpress org a while ago and am currently building my personal website with a custom theme  love it!	Everything from fun clips  trailers  music videos and video game walkthroughs to serious debates  lectures and documentaries	Brilliant plugin for Firefox and Google Chrome!

Dont have time to read it all though		
34433	haha can u really live without it??		
35764	Lemme check it out and Ill let you know!		
30074	I trust it more than I trust traditional media like newspapers  magazines etc		
77523	I love Gmail! As it is easy to use and also embedded with Many Google Apps at once which enables us to perform a lot while reading mails		
86479	Google always comes up with something new and interesting  And I agree  Google owns the world  Well  at least the digital world		
29093	its only getting better and better		
43380	Its become a part of daily life  Any site that can do that is win	Am mostly just in it for the forums  which are pretty solid

91850	llong time not used  but easy and reliable		
43373	its a good site to be look for it		
69921	Would have chosen love it which I did even have the premium  But there have been some glitches in the stream and artists like Dylan removed from catalog	Useful for when the other parts of the web fail such as email major sites etc  keep up to date with stuff including tv shows	Only gripe is it is getting way to big  partly because of ad ons which is why most of us love it  paradox  Chrome is much leaner and my first browser now	Not sure I will ever be able to fall in love with a social networking application  but Facebook is certainly the most popular  why? My space to messy?	Not perfect but as close as maters  To expensive for most users to justify the cost and recently to many superfluous features that dont work well	I have 7 Vista XP and Leopard running on my machines  Whilst 7 is better than Vista to say it is better than XP on stability is odd  still big driver glitches	Hard to fault it as a client this is near perfect extremely small foot print only wish other coders would learn from this	Only used it recently and so far so good  not perfect but hell what is  Looking forward to trying a little snow with it though	I only wish they could get a higher reliability but for what it costs it is one of the best applications out there  Could be better but doesnt have to be	I have it but rarely use it  but it is handy for the odd occasion I need it  For the rest of the time I have a text editor or wordpad	Tried many CMSs over the year but this beauty does everything I need and does it well  clean simple interface elegant stylish just use it! 8 sites using it	Not as hot on it as I was a year ago  Took the premium due to the upload limit  but never used it  Pro lapsed wont be renewing it  Something needs sorting out		
90522	likes to talk to de brods		
69928	at the moment we cant use facebook in my country Vietnam		
30068	Twitter is a statistical sample of the worlds brain & thus how we think   dont be a geek on Twitter and say statistical sample; people wont like you! :)		
30067	Twitter is great!  I was to be a Twenius!		
52250	Just a sharp enough learning curve to keep out some idiots   But accessible enough for an idiot like me		
57943	so far its ohk it aint that bad i gess wat eva just get use 2 it lol		
30069	Great example of good  relevant blogging	Its growth will bring eventual dilution of relevance  Will be around forever  but will someday be just that thing you used to do		
30064	Best App For Torrent Dloading		
77554	Safari is the best browser!		
30063	My favourite Twitter app  makes my life easier and less chaotic :D	Twitters fab! It lets me connect to my friends  stay up to date on news and media that interest me and follow my favourite celebs  artists  authors & more!		
77556	Anytime I dont think I like OS X  I think of Windows and shutter	Seamless integration with Mac OS X makes this the best sync solution out there	Took me a while to figure out what scrobbling is  but I like the idea	Amazing  Simply Amazing	Boring but functional interface  Loads of storage  but doesnt always play nice with clients because of its use of labels instead of folders	Really slick looking native Twitter app for the Mac		
34420	Hey Im Linux guy

57949	muahhhhh sayang zaha		
78889	ahhh   kok gw yg kena marah cih		
10450	I like the idea of it how I can email  chat and tweet all in one window  but it feels 80% done and needs better privacy		
89534	Really like the integration with Google Reader  And since its Google  future APIs might actually work (as opposed to certain other social media APIs)		
11786	Google is the best of the best search engine	Very improved Book marking site	One of the best Search Engine	Any body can try it  effective feed reader	Very useful SEO friendly browser  which supports almost all addons related to SEO work  I am a big fan of it	It works better with Iphones	An awesome browser supports Mac	The best email app		
90518	Its one of the best social networking websites Ive ever seen  Its just awesome as the concept of social networking and its linking with email is awesome!!!!

34413	I love Firefox  Its my home browser		
29077	Its getting betterer and betterer all the time		
34412	Works great  Good for publicity for blogs  great for discovering new things  way easier than news sites	Started with Outlook(with Comcast)  then Hotmail  Yahoo! Mail  then I found Gmail  And deleted all my other accounts	Its constantly open  I use it every day  great for designing  art  doodling  and the new screen sharing tool is amazing	Chrome is better for me  but if you want reliability  compatibility  standards compliant  and highly customizable  Firefox is the best choice	Prefer this over Flickr any day :D gives a huge sense of community		
35743	I also love it for its flexability to access my mail from anywhere and archive everything		
78872	The best torrent app	Some think Google Buzz could be the next huge social platform		
89529	i love it itz coolll		
78875	Skitch is great  It only sucks that the UI prevents me from saving an image that is higher than my screen  (The sharing tab is not available then )

77548	I host and post several blogs and it is so easy to use  coordinate and add on to	Yes Twitterfon is very nice but I do prefer Tweetie 2

69941	i love my parents and my friends		
91872	am addicted on this site cuz its so simple & cool at the same time		
6573	An online portal to your social life  Serves no real purpose and results in an overall loss of productivity for humanity  but hey  at least its not myspace	Excellent FOSS alternative web browser  Third party addons push it closer to perfection	A web browser that aggregates all your various social networking identities into one place for easy reference  Web 2 0 to the max	Google makes life in the digital age possible	Webmail that works  finally

30048	Pros: Currently a high active user base  convenient  connected to many apps  Cons: Hyped  over exaggerated  on its way down		
10438	i like the email and the ability to hide your real name from public profiles	i love it  but i really miss all the firefox add ons that simplify my life	its great for quick facts    not so great for academic research	I like it  but I like twitters format much better

38782	I like it   all my Twitter accounts + facebook in onw place  Similar 2 twitterdeck  but no video	The best business networking tool to come to the net so far (Twitter may steal that title!)		
94009	This rates hirer than LinkedIn as far as functionality goes but LinkedIn is more popular	One of the best sites for syncing files and backups  When I had to reinstall Windows 7  this is how I backed up all my files  It is a definite must!	This would be good but they just havent worked out enough of the problems for me yet	Keep track of everything in one place! Great app!	Great service! There is a video to suit your every mood!

And I can share them too!	Great for online photo sharing  I dont like the reduced capacity    but I get a free Pro account anyway! :D	A great way to pass on information and let people know what you are up to	There are some great videos on here    and with on demand TV its fantastic    when more films are on here then I doubt it will be beaten!	I like it    but not sure I fully get it yet  I feel it needs a way to let me know when I have new waves    or maybe this is the wrong approach	A once great browser is slowly showing its age  I still use it but have grown fonder of Chrome  Add ons are great     but there are too many good ones!!

9748	ALWAYS cutting edge   always cool and = useful info		
49542	i love blipper rosiealicepimm		
8415	A great desktop app for Twitter  Ive found myself using it more since their most recent update	Wonderful way to watch shows on the web  Excited to see where this one goes	Great social network for keeping up with everyone from long lost friends to coworkers and family    who am I kidding? I live on it	Makes sharing images on Twitter wonderfully simple  I also love that its integrated into TwitterBerry	Simply the best  I mean  cmon you dont say Yahoo it	If youre not on Twitter  you should be!	Great service that definitely fills a need with the disappearance of usernamecheck	I couldnt survive a days worth of news without it	Loving its new features on Mashable		
30936	love the new features  cant wait to play with it on my new 3G S!

38880	Browsers like chrome and opera are far better than a firefox without add ons  but the add ons are what make it outshine the competition		
30916	Exactly like Xbox Live but for PC  Buying a game is only a couple of clicks away  Pricey games in Europe due to 1 euro = 1 dollar conversion though	This is awesome  We can finally see the week (or a single day) in pictures from everyday people with ease	Something between blogger and twitter  Just what I always wanted and needed!	Definitely the best social networking news site  Learned and discovered a lot of things from it	Simple  effective and gorgeous  What else would you want?	Best blogging platform out there	I was trying to get into Twitter for a while until I figured all the available applications and iPhone apps  Since then  everything made more sense	Picking the songs you want hear  saving playlists  playing recommended songs and sharing everything makes this one a gem  Misses some necessary features though	I use it for a long  long time now and I simply cannot switch to anything else  Extensions and Greasemonkey scripts are an irreplaceable combination	Combined with OpenOffice  I never opened Microsoft Office ever again and my document management became completely free	Loco Roco clone  but a damn good one  Best iPhone game to date	Tried every IM and this one suits me the most  Connects to all networks including major social networks and email  Missing some features but nothing crucial	Offers the best online services and tools that make my life easier		
45178	lol     a new datacentre coz of twitter

Finally!		
13585	twitter is the sense of nanoConversation   real time microknowledge  i a combination with context streams will be the most used tools on earth ; )		
30925	copy/paste and text forwarding  No more retyping lengthy addresses :o)		
30924	Get implementation of the search function   Its just a scroll to the left  from the home page		
45170	It serves a necessary function  I suppose   The answer is not to change Yelp  but to develop and offer alternatives that fill make up for its shortcomings		
53604	Awesome resource for newbies  pros and or those trying to educate others on what twitter is all about  I love the design and usability of this e book as well!		
30921	Love it  but the backup is too slow!
