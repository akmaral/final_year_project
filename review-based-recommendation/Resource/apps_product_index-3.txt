Digg tells you	Its a great place for finding interesting stories  but not necessarily the most important stories one could find	The diggbar is frustrating  I wont be using it until they get rid of it	digg is the shit   period	the best site for news and pics!	Not accessible enough  though    I never remember to go there  Good for killing a couple of hours  though!	I like the idea but none of the news stories that have flashed up have tempted me to read them	Needs to change its game by finding a way for me to segment the diggs by users and groups whose opinion I trust  Not just the tech mobs opinion	Its ok  I wish it had a better way to get on the front page	Biased  full of trolls  forcefully witty  The existing established community rules what gets on the homepage and they seem to be the most obtuse on the net	nice little site	Digg didnt make it easy for me to bookmark or share links I come across  Delicious is much much easier  I lost hopes with Digg	I love Digg! Its so easy to keep track of my favorite sites   without pissing around with my bookmarks! I also like finding new sites with Digg :D	what can I say except I loveit	I always find an interesting site when Im at Digg	A great site for top 10 lists  otherwise not that great  The podcast is better  A good idea that has just run wild with worthless junk	I dont get it   Links to links that other people liked dont interest me	Amazing how a site about sharing among millions of people can be all about the same 25 people	great way of knowing whats happening on the web  and its based on what people liked so only good links come in	One of the best social media site  love the interface and easy to use	Unless they are screwing us over with diggbar  I still love em	fascist  underhanded services that goes against everything I love about social media  Whats up w/ Kevin Rose?

Opera is a Fast  Secure  Standards Compliant browser that inovates most of the features we love in modern browsers  It also has a friendly community	It is ok as my backup plan if FF goes wrong but it is no comparison to Firefox especially 3 5 beta version	I will never download opera again because theyve chosen to attack Microsoft rather than compete	I like it  but still having issues with a problem that Opera cased me several years ago during my thesis	loved it   love it   and will love it   ANy pRobs?	very good but dont work good with some javas	Mediocre  with a number of better options available	Opera comes with everything I need  No nasty addons to slow it down or crash it  Better on memory than firefox and more secure  Ignore the FF fanboys	Fast and feature rich  nothing really compares	crashes on some websites with a lot of javascript  and some facebook things are broke atm    hard to update too	Very fast web browser plus e mail client / feed reader  Very good for testing your own HTML files  besides Firefox	Cant really fault Opera on anything    it has the features I need and want in a browser	Great browser  Normally has features before other browsers	Very fast browser  but not compatible with some nonstandard pages	its fast and quick browser	may i lisen song youtube in it	best browser :)	While the mobile browser itself is good  the mobile emulator is absolutely excellent for testing mobile websites	I downloaded it just so I could be different than the Get Fx buttons	Without Opera who would Chrome and Firefox extension developers have to rip off?

390295	Sweet app!  Really giving Tweetie a run for its money!	Like it  but it keeps crashing on me	Tweetdeck crashes every hour on m pc  Why would I transfer that frustration to my phone?	Easy to set up after the download at the iTunes store  Set up the account to sync and it looks great  =D	Crashed twice after installing  Sluggish controls  UI is beautify  Room for improvement  a killer app!	Def beats tweetie  The interface is clean and it syncs my groups with my tweetdeck on my computer   Love it   Def earns its spot on my iphone!	Am I too greedy to wish I could add a Facebook column?	Definitely will compete with Tweetie  Not a Tweetdeck fan on my computer but may become a Tweetdeck fan on my iPhone  Crashed once so far  iPhone Hootsuite next	Cant find it in my apps to download   tried tweetdeck and tweet deck   what am I doing wrong?	Way better than any free app  for some reason I thought there was an integrated facebook status feed  also having problem creating a tweetdeck username	Love the interface  Not very stable (crashed 4 time already)  More customization would be nice (bg color  refresh rate)  Good so far  wanting updates soon	Clearly early version  sluggish  too much going on  already crashed on me once  Sticking with Tweetie for now	Looks cool and works ok  Crashed once already  not on App Store WiFi yet  Go to desktop Itunes @nonprofitadvice	Its tiny a little hard to read  I first thought I could enlarge columns  Not bad though its useful to perhaps check all my groups quickly  Im mixed	Created a group  could not add people  nor could I delete the group  Potential is there  not ready for release	Really digging new #Tweetdeck for iPhone/iPod touch  lots of features  Loving the layout	Love the UI  Very clever way to display multiple panels of content   Excellent work TD Team!	I would love it if I could update facebook at the same time  I thought that was one of the features	Love the UI  but it has crashed on me 5x in first 5 minutes of use	* Crashed twice * Told me I wasnt connect to internet  I was * Like the UI * Limits refreshes to 100/hr?! Likely wont hit that but if I do Id drop it	One more reason to love my iPhone  Ive been using it for twenty minutes and its been great	What about facebook updates? The desktop version does it	So far  not bad  I like the UI + functionality  Some hiccups though  Something backend unstable  Also annoyed @ req 4 superlong password  Whats up with that?	Works great! Remember to restart your Iphone after installation	Ugly and crashes a lot	it works great! awesome app	Missing features  UI is a little hard to navigate  Dont like having to mark tweets as read  Overall its still nice  though Im sticking with tweetie for now	some bugs but it looks good so far   Faster than TwitterFon	Overall great UI  cool way of managing columns  it lacks the ability of selecting friends to add in tweets  I like anyways  Prefer TwitterFon yet	It works better with Iphones	The more I use it  the less I like it  Crashes  screens dont completely draw  UI was cool at first but quickly becomes annoying  Back to Tweetie for me	I think that people will like it because it reminds them of the Pre a bit   a bit buggy and would like Facebook integration (maybe ping fm like tweetie)	THE BEST TWITTER APP FOR IPHONE EVER!! I think it is so far	Looks and feels right  But I would like a landscape keyboard option	So far it seems pretty good  Like all first versions there are some glitches  The best part is how it syncs with the desktop version to keep all your groupings	Works very well for me  Great design  I like the sync and multiple accounts feature  Well done	works as expected    on three different computers + ipod touch	nice but the internal browser is slow and sometime get stuck	Im trying to like TweetDeck for the iPhone  but I can do more with tweets on Tweetie than I can in TweetDeck  Columns are great; Memory hog  lacks features	Love that columns sync between this & desktop over air; wish sync kept track of whats been read though  Anyone figure out a way to do this?	Desktop version is good  but this is too much for an iPhone app  Just need basic features  and Tweetie or Twitterrific are better for that	Is definitely a Twitter client that Ive been waiting for  but agree that its not for the casual Twitter users  See my detailed review http://tr im/td4iphone	May love it later  I love Desktop Tweetdeck so a replicated experience on iPhone rocks  Tracking  whats been read across both would really rock	Much better execution that its desktop counterpart!	better than twitteriffic  plus no ads	Best looking iPhone Twitter app  Columns are great! Crashes a little too often and doesnt seem to sync with desktop version properly	Very nice design to it and there arent any ads but I personally prefer Twitteriffic	I use this on my Iphone touch  Great Job!	cant live without it   keeps my Tweeps upfront and center! and lets me organize contacts  thx TweetDeck @cirina http://www digitalproductionbuzz com	Theres nothing better than having Twitter available for you at all times! Outside of the random crash or 2  this has been my favorite way to Twit on my iPhone!	This is a really great twitter app  It has a nice design  Although sometimes it gets kind of crowded in my opinion  Its also as good as the desktop version	My favourite out of all the free iPhone Twitter apps Ive used   I use it all the time	tweetdeck for iphone is an excellent app	Much better than Twinkle and other Tweeting application ! Nothing to say about it but an unimportant thing	Very good app for using Twitter on the iPhone  It does crash occasionally on my iPhone  though

Of the four bookmarking services I have used I keep coming back to delicious  Still the most reliable!

Its unfortunate that the service for those outside the US isnt the same as within  Excellent service  and lovely interface	its a def  step in the right direction   but  come on  its 2009 and im still getting cut short even with a brand new imac on this and things like it	Its a great concept  put to work in an excellent manner  Wonderful!

Hulu is the only way I watch tv anymore but if they start charging Ill find another way	Interesting  in Mexico  I can use youtube  but not Hulu :(	I cannot watch a show continously with out a pause   whats with that?  I am running a media PC?	could run smoother  and have a bit better organization (i know it goes against their aesthetic)	But no more TDS and Colbert Report is :((((	Doesnt work in teh UK!

Tem tudo para ser a proxima grande onda da Internet  It has everything to be the next big wave of the Internet	I am waiting for this  With Google Wave i can connect with the property buyers from all over the world in real time who want to invest in Pune real estate marke	Without many people in its hard to say    And its loaded with bugs too  Awesome nonetheless	Cant wait to see wave expand to its potential	i don have patience to wait : ) fast!!!!	cool   cant wait to wave around~~	Iam a french guy who wants other people to work with me ! Im sure Google Waves is the better tool   I use to use Google Documents at my computer club (abill	I never heard of this one!  Hmmm   Google is making changes!	i had attended its demo in pune India its cool	fellow blippers would love to have an invite to review wave <3  invitationandstuff@gmail com	We are online and write to please our audience  And Google is doing a great job at pleasing their audience  They are real influencers in the Internet scenario	lot of things dont work yet but who cares	Once you start figuring it out  it becomes less an oddity and a powerful conversation tool   I especially love the ability to make and track aside comments	I love the concept and I have been invited as well  Quite cool  Id say	The potential of this collaboration platform is huge	it is by far the cooles thing on the web very interative  user frndly and just amazing  now i have a paper to write can i have wave  i want to edit some stuf	Wave is awesome  still slightly gimmicky but awesome none the less!	Google Wave is Awesome   It will Change   how we will interact online Totally One Day	Gr8 app but need to find more people to ride the Google Wave with  hmm wonder if I have any invites to give yet	So far im loving it    but theres a lot of work to do! and i do not have any doubt u guys will pulled it of!	I watched the wave video and really liked it alot! Im just mad i havnt got an invite yet!	Got my invitation yesterday and Its great!  Still need to get more people on board	lets Try and fry !!!!!!!!!!!!	I believe this program will change lives!	in principal looks interesting   But I think it needs to be applied properly	Incredible tools to communicate   cant wait it goes public and build things with it!	Microsoft wins in this area	Looking forward to collaborating on some very open ended projects with Wave	Google Wave is cool	The Google Wave preview takes a little getting used to  It will only come into its own when the floodgates open and everyone you know/work/share has access	A useless memory hog!	No contacts  no use   and ho do you get contacts if you only get 8 invites?! Nope  I can see the brilliance  but not   yet   the use	I liked it a lot just by looking at it  But Its not sending any invite to me from long time    :( :(	best parts of the internet into one  but i have no one to wave with  so    meh	I love google wave i can manage my project on it with my colleagues	great for collaborations with others  works best in chrome	good but like most of googles things its over hyped and i think wont be of use to a mass market	I believe in Google Wave	Potential?  Huge   Current state of the product?  Collapsing under the weight of its own hype	I think its great     but could do with more intergration from google chat     Would be nice to be able to use it in a desktop app rather than on the browser	Its just beta so far  but I think it looks cute  Though  I was kind of hoping that it would be able to kill msn  But Im having doubts	I wanted to see if it could live up the hype so I checked it out right away  I must say  it looks promising so far	It is so buggy at the moment and as slow as a zx81 running quake  I want to like it but it has a long way to go yet  and it needs more users to be useful	man its sleek and fast  But better if i can have my whole list of friends so i can test out many of its features	I really love Google Wave~	hhhmmm      its must b rocking	Google wave allows for instant viewing and use of items not available in IM (documents  charts etc )  The concept is awesome  and its not there yet  but soon	Google Wave is amazing! but Im learning how to use and I need more friends   XD	Embedded in my site it looks cool but no user ctrl=to risky to deploy http://www involvednews com/Science and Technology/Technology/Google Wave/google wave html	I think there is some real potential replacing e mail  But they need backwards compatibility and a standard for others to base on	It is interesting  I like its IM/Email thingy  I think Google needs to open it to all by next year	fuckdup web browser :)	hey maamam it amzing	i love google and these each service	Like it at the Beta stage  Maybe when it becomes rock solid  will love it! Google rocks always anyway!!	Google Wave  is a revolutionary way of communicating  But its no replacement for Email  Its far from it  Currently Wave is just another new Social Network	Probably still lack a rework of the organization (youll have small informal messages with highly polished Waves all together)	I will more than likely upgrade my review on this but as it stands right now there is not a lot going on Google Wave   More content needed	I love it but it has a long way to go it needs to be more intuitive thank God for forums such as http://www waveletforum com   much needed help!	Realy nice service  I love the way u can mix functionality like posting a tweet  a blog and how you can start a conversation between more than 2 people	Cannot wait to see this service take over the world	Google Wave has the potential to make work fun  not the other way around	I really like Google Wave!	Currently theres not a whole lot you can do with it  It does not deserve the hype  and maybe itll have potential later but now its just fluff	I loved t  but I need friends on it to really test its potential  Here is my Google Wave address: CCEJean@googlewave com	I like the idea of Wave  but have found no friends who have accounts   So far  Im just waving at the air	yes i like it but it ignor indian ppls	I have been using it to co ordinate team projects and everyone loves it  Has a way to go  but its amazing!	Excellent for projects and collaboration where teams are distributed indifferent cities and contintents  Finding it difficult to convert some people tho	Quanto mais usarmos  melhor nos comunicaremos  O futuro surfa na Google Wave!!!	Has potential  but I cant stand extremely slow interface	Nice try  but i dont think this is gonna start a revolution	good  very good thing :)	The best collaborative solution ever!	Love it! Really excited to see how people start using it	http://www atfyi com http://www atdirectory com http://www allarcades com http://www greensboro at http://www squidoo com/listingdirectory http://www look	I love the idea of it  but think alot of people dont get it  Google need to promote it more!	Google Wave has so much potential   The trouble is getting an Invite  I managed to get mine by going to http:  waveaccess webs com	http://www atfyi com http://www atdirectory com http://www allarcades com http://www greensboro at http://www squidoo com/listingdirectory http://www look	got into early   still think its developing; can see it making a dent w/i the corporate world;non corp  not enough bandwidth to appreciate   slow adoption	Getting more into Google Wave  But its fiddly  UI needs to be smoother  Makes a big difference testing with purpose  than testing for fun  Seems more stable	Its a nifty tool  Havent used it much yet  but convenient for a few things that require collaboration with easy saving/editing	With time  this could replace email  but it needs time to mature and have a developer community grow before it gains widespread adoption  Best for collaboration	It will never be like Gmail until it builds on gmail (i e  incorporates non wave email communication )	now if only more people started using it	its been quite a while ive been using this with my clients and collegues  works like a charm for collaboration and communication / info sharing	An amazing collaboration tool that you can use with your co workers to communicate in real time!	It has big potential  but it is a year or more from replacing anyones email	I prefer all of google products  but Wave are still hard to understand to me  if someone want to help me about this send me invite on sreckomikulic@googlewave	An incredible idea but still a long way from people understanding its true potential I feel  perhaps when the APIs are more fleshed out	Google Wave is definitely the new wave of next generation communication	if more people used it it would be awesome   Now though  its just confusing	I love google wave	Very advanced for our time  wait some years and you will see    I think it will revolution the internet!	Another promising masterpiece from the big G  Im sure ill love it even more once i get used to its features	Google owns your entire lives and ALL your personal information  You have no concept of all the evil behind this corporate monopoly  Such sad  misled sheeple	Ever want to e mail  chat  blog  wiki  all in one? now you can	I found this excellent Google Wave Community site  http://waveaccess webs com  Got my invite within the hour	I like it    but not sure I fully get it yet  I feel it needs a way to let me know when I have new waves    or maybe this is the wrong approach	its a bandwidth hog!! and a resource hog!! bad google	Like it  but there are only a few ppl around there	Interesting  but I dont see much value in it  Its just an experiment right now	Neat  but needs to be more available on 3rd party services before I use it daily  It was nice to use it in a classroom environment  though	Wave made me realize how great Gmail is  Good work  google! Im sticking to gmail	its ok  I cannot see what all the hype was about and why people were paying for invites   maybe its because I    just dont get it	I truly tried to use Wave  but the problem is that I  just like many others  do not really get the idea behind it   GOOGLE  needs to further develop it	Google failed to make a case for it so far  To me  Wave is just over hyped instant messenger that nobody may ever be able to comprehend	Im still committed to it  Theres lots of potential left  Maybe marry it to Buzz?	Lots of potential  and lots of work to go before this is something Ill love  I look forward to the day I can love it	A very neat idea but needs vast major improvements  There is a lot of potential to this application but will take time for it to improve	Great  but missing out on some features	Definitely has a lot of potential  but nothing is missing  Great product  easy to use  really useful  Still  it may take some time to improve it	lot of potential  lot of lag  lot of not everyone uses it so i wont too	Really cool idea   I hope it takes off	good idea i hope it becomes the new windows live	Love the app but not enough users on it yet	think google has been cutting edge from the stat There is no telling were and how far the amazing TEH is going to go I want to be and know everything there is	Need more connections with it  But over all it has a lot of potential like everyone else is saying	Mostly useless  but when its useful  its really useful  Collaborative design seems to be its niche	its ok  but i agree: more for work collaboration  i used it a lot for a couple months	I like it personally and I think itll take off once it get into the mainstream	Cool concept  but it needs a LOT of work to be actually useful  Pretty user unfriendly  Could be awesome once theyve done more work on it	Will be more useful when it is released to public!	I like it for its collaborative document editing feature  but whats different from Google Docs ? Will be more interesting if deployed in my company Google Apps	I still havent found a way to use it  but I like it none the less  it has a lot of potential	Hi  this ist my first time using wawe	Its useless without very many contacts  otherwise itd be awesome!	great platform for being connected	please invite me (amanda orangejeruk@gmail com) thanks   :)	I have been playing with this the day the developer beta became available and its great for comment boards on websites and forums but in a stand alone app no	I really want to use this app more  but it doesnt seem to be getting any traction  Would love to see integration with Gmail	could someone please send me an invitation (nawheele@gmail com) thanks so much!	anyone has an invite left? would appreciate it	so much potential but no one i know uses it so :/  hey ill give an invite for a follow here :D	bagus  tapi mungkin terlalu kompleks	send me a google wave invitation please  felipe andres sanchez batallas@gmail com

514309	it makes twitter so much more enjoyable probably the best twitter app there is	Turns Twitter into something like Facebook  Kind of defeats the 140 character / brevity advantage of Twitter  And they reportedly censor   not cool!	I like the @replies in every profile  Also  is very useful the shorten link  daily question and photo features  The bad is that I cant create groups	u like this  cengjeng  ceng  jetjetjejt		
517813	This is the greatest tool for making your online content shareable	Easy integration  versatile sharing options  complete customization	great social networking companion	A must have for those of us that enjoy and want to easily share content to our favorite social media hubs  a 10/10 from me	This very great app :D	I use it daily :)		
338262	Keep in touch with friends by installing GFC on your site  The widget brings up icons of all the people connected on that site so you  can see whos online	Friend Connect is constantly getting better	I have been using if to help promote my blogs and website  My blog here has generated alot of traffic from frienconnect http://anything4lessonline blogspot com/	Facebook Connect is so much more useful	I think google has been cutting edge from the stat There is no telling were and how far the amazing TEH is going to go I want to be and know everything there is		
392368	Amazing CMS  You can build any site with this	Using drupal to build my website  http://www matthewbreuer com	Love it (even though I actually havent used it yet)	Brilliant framework  Simply the best CMS out there	A great CMS  Very flexible and powerful	Very flexible  with a smart  generous  hardworking community   For a simple blog it was easier to install and tweak Wordpress though		
338386	I use it for everything: schoolwork  my own writing  and I absolutely love all the options for spreadsheets  presentations  and documents  I use it daily :]	google docs are great  and free  and always accessible  take that ms office	free  shareware over the internet    and compatible with MS and Open Offices   :D	Im a google fan  have been for years  I like being able to have certain docs stored online for easy access for myself and others	Its a good place to store my documents so I can access them easily	I dont need something with as many features(and annoyances  in my experience) as word  Google Docs is very simple  and its cloud based  which is nice	bagus  tapi masih perlu pengembangan		
336879	a horrible creepy website with a shocking privacy policy	For what it does  it does well  (Side note: this is my first iPhone blip!)	I really love the site  although it might just be the sweet virtual bookshelfs you get!	Excellent site with an excellent community  It does what it says  and quite well  Keep track of books youve read  own  want to read  want  or get suggestions	a great way to get motivated about your reading	Good for online shelf  Appearance wise this is the best of the virtual shelves  Clear cover pics and fancy cases	A beautiful way to display your book collection on the internet	I like their interface  but I wish they support RSS for books in my shelf  Their community features could also use some tuning  Its still a great website thou!	Ive just discovered Shelfari and I love it  I will move my collection over from My Bookshelf  I just hope it stays free	Just got on  and I love the concept and the interface  Brilliant idea	Great way to keep track of your books  the beautiful interface is a plus as well	Blippr is better  cus it has everything	great one for book reader   viva reading	Been on two years building my shelf  made wonderful virtual book club pals	Pretty good application  I just started building my shelf	A great way to plan out what you are going to read next and see what you have read before  You can also make some good friends in the process	I like Shelfari  have been a user for over a year and love the improvements they have made over time   An iPhone app would easily make this review a Love It

336764	Great messenger  if not a little limited by its protocol usage	I dont use it all the time  but its a really nice app when I do	Has easily become my favorite instant messaging program over the last year or so   Cant remember the last time I bothered logging into another	Its alright  wish it had screen sharing and copy/paste graphic support ;)	Being able to chat within Gmail is great   Blackberry App is a memory hog though	1st Jabber client I used  and good enough at what it does  but I dont have a use for it over other multi protocol IM clients  Good app  but not for me anymore	Very nice    Only setback is few people (I know) use it	Nice and simple but its Digsby for me for its integration of all the services I use   If those services in Gtalk then Id swap  : )	I use Gtalk everyday  it never fails	I like their drag and drop support	Simple and Fast with great features!	Very useful tool  I use Gtalk everyday  is nice and simple and also emoticons are nice! Is my favourite instant messenger	I use the non Labs desktop client and it rocks  Use the call feature to talk with family   Searchable conversation history in Gmail is really handy	i like it so much but we still wait for more improvements	Clean/simple/reliable   Unfortunately  i cant get anyone to join Google Talk! DAMN MSN!!	Nothing here that other chat clients dont already do better	like others have said  theres not much special to it  the one nice thing is it connects to gmail automatically  But IM is 10 years ago	Its a great communication tool  its better than the msn	The desktop client is terrible but the talk on gmail is great	Most of the time I see it  its not working properly  Stupid	Pointless  Not innovative  Yet another instance of Google trying to butt in where Microsoft and Yahoo! rule	Gtalk help alot around the office and in my home life  Staying connected with people is really what its all about  Get connected through gtalk!	If you want chat in your browser  get meebo	Back when I had a PC  Gtalk was my main IM client  I cant wait till theres a mac version	Only Windows  Puuuu  But the accounts actually use XMPP/Jabber	good  use it on Blackberry and desktop  would like video chat to be incorporated as is in chat from GMail	think google has been cutting edge from the stat There is no telling were and how far the amazing TEH is going to go I want to be and know everything there is	Just doesnt appeal	the UI for gtalk is REALLY BAD     There is no function to say    Let incoming message blink on the task bar until I am ready to read it    it just pops up!!	huh  bcause u  i can dance already babe !	kurang fitur dibandingkan aplikasi lain		
390505	Loving the copy/paste (finally!)   Spotlight is awesome too	Cant enough of the new OS   search  cut/copy/paste   finally!	Im a huge fan of push notifications and landscape for my emails! Finally!	Love it!!!!  iPhone has come of age!	I am finally able to type emails with two thumbs!	the voice memo app  looks slick  landscape mode for all native apps! hurrah!	It seems glitchy to me    I was hoping for improved performance  but it`s even slower now  Oh well :)	Seems a little slow  Is it just me? Nice to have Copy/Paste  Spotlight is cool!	i wish i could trade my old iPhone in for a new one  my screen freezes up and prevents me from enjoying the new update!	Love it  but the backup is too slow!	Its as Apple had described but more  Although the missing features found only in iPhone 3G S has convinced me to upgrade http://tr im/oDB5	eh  i was hoping for more  slower  over hyped  2g phones not really considered   no compass  no v command  spotlight and landscape are essential tho	I really like being able to copy/paste  Also gotta love landscape mode for all native apps  Push notifications are good too but still seem a little glitchy	Spotlight is great  Find my iphone as well !	copy/paste and text forwarding  No more retyping lengthy addresses :o)	Get implementation of the search function   Its just a scroll to the left  from the home page	MMS is not enabled at all (no icon or anything in text) for AT&T Cust  will it come in an update?	love the new features  cant wait to play with it on my new 3G S!	I cant say i love it because i think they should have gave us the Voice Control app to all and not only to 3Gs What can i say  its free  cant complaint more	only wish AT&T would get off their ass and enable all the features!	Great cut and paste  search options and landscape emails and messages  Quality on sound record excellent  Thanks Apple : )	So far    horizontal texting and emailing  new photo features and voice memos are awesome  even on my first gen iphone!!

Fanstastic!	Features which should have been in version 1 0 & it wont install on my WM6 1 phone :)	tethering for the masses! hell yeah!!!	I dont get the premium price for features that have been around for years on other phones	been waiting for it all day  love it!	Cant beat it  Works as advertised	Finally  the iPhone gains much needed functionality that brings it almost on par with every other phone on the market	My favs:  the new Spotlight (search) options and copy & paste   Im STILL going through all the small changes	Its getting there  but perhaps feels a bit stale   Spotlight search is the best though	like it mostly   but 3G wont stay connected now   keeps going back and forth between 3G and EDGE   ICK	its wonderful! like a whole new iphone if you have first gen like me	Everything missing to iphone is know available	It was great having copy and past	Pretty much negates any need for me to jailbreak my iPhone   For Now	Just an update but a useful update at that  Apple Rocks	digging the copy/paste  but wish the hover bubble was more like hover arrows so you could determine exactly how many characters youre back tracking through	   the best iphone software me made   youll love it! :D	Never used the previous versions  but 3 0 does more than I ever though a phone could do  With th right apps  the features like the compass become essential	Programming for the iPhone is much easier now   if only theyd make memory management more transparent	As a first generation Apple iPhone user who upgraded to the 3G and then 3GS  the OS 3 0 brought so much new features which took the platform to a new level!	One of the best updates for iPhone and iPod Touch! :)	Do you want to post images to your blog in my Japanese blog?	Adds many great features and improves existing ones		
337059	Love it   Love being able to see places Ive been and showing them off to others	Just on of the most useful apps ever	dont use it as much as one might think I would  use Google Maps online much more	Lots of fun and interesting to see the rest of the World   Very  very useful	Im waiting for the day when Google simply doesnt blow my mind  Google Earth vastly went beyond anything I had expected of it	Really fun to visit all the places in the world  The graphics and 3 D reprentations are great	Its really good idea but Im always scared with the over expose features which can make criminals to get information easily Seriously consider this  !!!	Great! Quite Large  but Simple and High Quality!	THE BEST  MAPPING SOFTWARE   i cant believe i  can see my homes satellite   pix    its awesomely good :)	Its beautiful  plain and simple	Im addicted to Google Earth; its like a videogame with no loser	i love flight simulator on google earth  I also like the addition of mars  day/nite  mars  sky and all that  great stuff	So freaking cool! Download a copy and go explore your planet  Be sure to check out the topography  too  Mount Everest is really hard to find  though	great for finding places  and stalking pmsl!!	See the world from your door step   know where youre heading to and with street view   guess I cant lost as easily now   Just need to plan ahead	Greatest thing since sliced bread!	Pretty friggen awesome	Google Maps is a tool  Google Earth is a toy  I like zooming around the globe  but I honestly cant find a real use for it	For the US  the pictures are awesome  For Thailand  you can barely get a feeling of the neighborhood  but its certainly more fun to use than GoogleMaps	Good  solid app  Fun and easy to use	Has many features  Including a trip around the galaxy!	I like the google earth But i wan to see my home side sectar i cant see it	Cant remember what I did before! Tremendous tool for realizing how the planet is not that big and were all very similar	Its fun  Im not sure how its very useful  But its fun	love the gratuitous shots of pasture	its really spectacular but i am looking forward to even more so   esp  when i can afford the prof  version	Great Program      Very Cool!!!!	The perspective is wonderful  Just like Beth Midlars song God Is Watching Us	I love Google Earth   Another awesome Google creation!	Really fun to play around on  and useful as a map as well	I use it to give directions   way better than a map!!	Fun to browse around on and its tools are great	Great entertainment  Dont use it regulary though	This is one of the coolest things Googles done  I use it for finding where I need to go  scope out places I need to be  and just find neat things in the world	It is very fun to play with  and very cool for a map program as well  I like finding new places with it	Amazing project  There are no words to thank people that made it  It is outrageous	How could you not love being able to explore the world?	Sometimes I having fun with this program  Looks great on the widescreen monitor	A good way to waste an hour or so when youre really bored!	A good way to explore the world	If you love looking down on the world Google Earth was made in heaven for you	Who doesnt love Google Earth?	I love google earth  With all of its options and layers you can have fun  and really do more than just find your house  I enjoy the Panoramio feature!	Very cool  but pointless for daily use	So awesome  And makes planning trips fun!	It isnt exactly useful because most of the time Im wasting time using it but Google Earth is nonetheless really cool!	great way to waste time (cool too)	wasted hours on that globe	YAY!! I CAN SEE MY HOUSE FROM HERE!	very very exciting with this applications great	Awesome  Again  its hard to believe to live without it  However  the linux client doesnt feel really native  Still nice to have one!

I used it to map part of a cemetery	Travel the world while in your pajamas!  Great satellite images combined with 3D models!

It was a very entertaining when it first came out but it can get boring after	Very cool app  With third party hardware/software it just gets better!	A fun application with a lot of practical uses	if only they had it in my high school geography	Words cannot describe how amazing this application is  who would have thought I would be able to check out the world and zoom right in just from my chair!	I use the iphone app all the time  The detail is amazing	Kind of a toy  Doesnt do much more than Google Maps  Could be clearer how to overlay information	Great  helped me a lot    Amazing pictures	maps is enough  never needed earth	think google has been cutting edge from the stat There is no telling were and how far the amazing TEH is going to go I want to be and know everything there is	A great map  but compared to maps  there is no reason to spend time downloading and installing	i enjoy virtually touring  taking screenshots  then editing so it looks like a painting  very fun	unless someone comes out with something better  this is the app of choice! :)	Fun and cool    but I dont know how useful it is	Its great  and the flight simulator is very addictive	Love it by why do we need the separate application they should just integrate all the features into google maps	serasa menjelajahi dunia		
336762	I love when I have it plugged in  But when I dont  I hate it saying I need to update  Argh!	Im a Flash Developer  so gotta say I love Flash :)	Could be better  Wish it didnt sap the processor so much  But where would we be without it  Its a big component of http://iMapWeather com	What a way to be LEAN :)	Well ya kinda need it nowadays  ; )	Being a Flash developer  I have nothing bad to say about it  :) Too processor intensive  Thats it  Really	Please  bring on HTML5! Flash causes the vast majority of crashes on OS X  It slows the system down and is generally horrible	It gets the job done  I cant wait until we do most of what Flash does nativly in the browser	Seriously? The innovation of the web at its best	Great application but websites shouldnt use it as their whole website	Could someone please develop a better Flash program for the Android phones?	It works  but HTML5 is better for video  Also  its a piece of crap on 64 bit linux  Thanks for crappy linux support Adobe! Thanks for no SVG in IE8  Microsoft!	Good for animations  but NOT FOR WEB!!	Good  But needs to much effort	85% of Alexa top 100 web sites use Flash	Great to build games  The idea of having it on the web is incredibly stupid just adding a useless component that can have its tasks completed other ways		
336760	A great service that is very helpful when finding new apps to try!	A great idea  wonderfully executed by an exceptional team	Recently discovered this web app & very interesting it is too  Some nice stats  Though I feel the novelty may wear off after a bit  EDIT: Good discovery tool	Its Last fm for software  Tracking works well  but recommendations need to be more intelligent (e g   I obviously dont need Hotmail if Im using Gmail)	This is a great tool for seeing which apps and pages you use the most  as well as for finding new ones to match your style!	I use it and I like it  I found some great sites  just by seeing other users use them	Great way to see alternatives to applications you use day in and day out	sgood for finding new apps and getting updates	Great idea  site and software	not that important if u r using plip its enough	its really helpful if you need to reinstall you system  you have a list of what you were using	one of the coolest social networking ideas	Interesting to see how long you use your software for etc	blippr is better  but this is automated	After a year of membership i can tell  its good to see your statistics  You will be able to read your habitats related to your computer usage with softwares	Awesome statistics and software recommendations tracker!	Its make all my passion about digging new app worth

577072	Interesting idea  A definite good first offering  though I think itll need to mature a bit before it can be a serious contender	I like this  but I must say this should be stand alone rather than being inside of GMail and lot of developments to done	Not sure the inbox is the right location though	i am trying google buzz from mobile  its awesome  now i can share my location and images instantly at google buzz  it recognizes my street address from map	tweets should appear momentarily and not 5 hours after they were written  they have to make a push twitter of some kind :) otherwise  its a good concept	Some think Google Buzz could be the next huge social platform	Nice  but with room for improvement  Given its immediate scale  however  I think people will find this a compelling complement to their social media addictions	I like it so much :)  its easy to use  and you can share news easily and call others to see it :) I love it	Just found Google Buzz  Giving it a try  linked my twitter  flickr and youtube accounts to it   I dont get it yet	Like it better than Facebook and twitter  but needs to improve usability	Need a =/ choice here  Dont really know if I like it or dislike it yet  The privacy faux pas was a major dork move tho  Surprisingly bad call on Googles side	Love having a social app in my gmail   but it needs a few more features and tweaks for me to love it	Its twitter with comments  but you have to change your email address to use it	@turi319: would you like to expand on that??? I think Google got it right  this is going to change social media for ever	a better tool than twitter	thanks google now i can finally share things with people via the internet	I am not yet convinced about the usefulness of Buzz  contrary to the hype about it  For one  it absolutely needs FB integration to capture my long term interest	its a clever way of bringing people back from Facebook inbox    I for one  will have to now take my google mail more seriously in order to use buzz	Its like Friendfeed 2 0! I love it!	Its a pretty good interface	Ignoring the opt out button? Bad move	Ainda experimentando  e sem entender muito bem	As far me using Buzz  I think it will have to be able to do and show a lot more for me to get excited over	lots of useful stuff  yes some tweaks will further improve it	It has its place in social networking  but its too hard to navigate and lacks too many features (like mute and collapse buttons) at the moment	im not enjoying the fact that even though i have a mostly private profile  its still asking me to create a public profile	A good concept but needs a lot of major improvements  The UI is nice and simple which is Google  It needs better twitter and facebook integrations	Google bosses have made an apology for breaches of privacy resulting from Buzz! Treat with caution until they resolve ALL these issues! Ive shut Buzz down!	like facebook twitter and friendfeed all rolled into your gmail	Great place for conversation  but needs a lot of work  such as lists and many other things Friendfeed has	So much better than Google Wave  I still think this wont be the Twitter Killer most people are expecting it to be	Didnt really appeal to me the way it was set  and with all those privacy issues    even Google thinks it wasnt ready to be released	As of now  I am not a fan  My opinion might change over time though	Ok  I get it  Buzz  I get it  I think       http://www google com/buzz/stevenaleach/4xJimLoeQMK/Ok I get it Buzz I get it I think Most of the	Nice service  It add some feature to twitter and with Gmail  you have all in one place	Destined for greatness (I hope)  No need to carve a new niche  just do it better than Twitter  and the user base is already there	Might win Twitter users	Initially  Google Buzz is devoid of all the nonsense that has become a mainstay in twitter  I think the convos and topics are a lot more informative	Like it   definitely has room to grow  and needs to in some areas  Potential to rival Twitter  but not yet	i try to combine twitter with buzz	Wish I had more time to check this out  I just want a nexus one  lol!	Useless social platform  At least Gmail on Google Apps doesnt have THIS!	Havent used it very much  but from what Ive seen  it seems very stable and well made  As with any Google application	This is much better looking than Facebook and doesnt have as mush down time	Although Google Buzz is still in its infancy  it does show huge potential  Somewhat useful as an aggregator  Privacy & security issues remain substantial	Its hard to tell right now  but the integration of several services in one place is potentially useful  I still post more Twitter updates than Buzz ones though	Trying to get it all figured out still  Not sure why the Buzz layer for maps is not available on the desktop  I plan on giving it a fair try	Like it  but it needs a little work still   Too hard following people that have a lot of updates and comments	I like it so far  HUGE potential  so plenty of room to Love it! in the future	Really like the integration with Google Reader  And since its Google  future APIs might actually work (as opposed to certain other social media APIs)	I like it so far but I think Google could really improve it in the next year  I cant wait to see what they come up with	Good to share and discuss about everything!	I am not a real fan of Facebook  so alternatives are always good  Buzz a but confusing & slow for now  but it has a good prospect to grow	Great way to discuss and communicate! Will work great with with FreezeCrowd someday!	Its a cool social tool    great talking to intellects rather than dummys all day on Twitter    lol j/k	Great and comfortable  Gmail and Social Networking all at one place	Nicely integrated with other Google services  but unfortunately not widely adopted  Yet	Buggy but interesting and encourages discussion   Love it	The potential of Buzz is immense  but Google have never been great when it comes to design and useability in my opinion  Ill still be using it though	Google buzz same as twitter	Just starting out with it  but the idea is great  Like the integration  We will see in a few weeks	yes  I like buzz  its freely talk it on time  also we are wedding dresses factory  custom made according to your measurement  www yrshopping com	Its just a copycat product  Im giving it a chance  but I dont see why I would use it over Twitter  with a lack of 3rd party clients and forceful integration	Its much better than face book  i prefere it too	Well nothing new in it  Also since its in GMAIL security risk	should never have put it within google mail  needs its own site before ill regularly use it	not relevant  not easy to understand  not following anyone I know well  not using it other than as a friendfeed automatic update	Site assumes you know how to use it  Needs getting started and clear BENEFITS to users  Also need a way to make profile public	Literally nobody I know is using it  As far as Im concerned they should rename it Google Crickets	Do not see the point in Buzz and all the buzz around buzz is giving me a buzzing headache :)	Not quite ready for prime time  but with time it will be compelling	Does it have a point? I use real email for work contacts  and message friends in other ways  so only have 1 buzz to pay attention to	Functionality  good   Privacy  bad  Hulk not like puny Buzz	Think its the root of all evil	It is annoying to see hundreds of comments that take up the whole screen for just one buzz	I havent seen a TON of difference between this and twitter other than you can post longer sentences and your profile is more accessible to strangers	I think google buzz will be better once people on google buzz talk about more than google buzz and whether google buzz is better than twitter or facebook	Its a bit shit  really	im not really a big fan of facebook and not on it  and im one of the people who left Buzz for privacy stuff  so for now im sticking with twitter	I am okay with facebook and stuff without Buzz   I found Buzz slightly confusing   great idea   maybe I check it sometime later	Its way too noisy  Buzz will eventually fade imo + hate the integration of several services in one place  This is a fail	I wish it would integrate with facebook and would update my twitter/facebook status when I buzz something	Cant see it catching on with FB and Twitter already doing this  Maybe useful for businesses but a bit late for Google on releasing this Want to be proved wrong	Interactive  instant and inimitable!	It is fine and is well integrated with Gmail and Google reader but is not a must use tool from my perspective	Massive invasion of privacy means Im too afraid to use it  Dont even want to use my googlemail anymore	Meh  Good infrastructure  very little thought given to user experience  security model  use cases  Dont let programmers design user facing services	90% of content is just syndicated tweets right now  Sorry Google  people just dont need one more digital distraction	Evil  Ignores privacy concerns  rushed to market and looks ugly  encourages piping feeds  and linked to gmail which I dont like or understand	Has lots of promise  needs better integration  needs Android app  makes Gmaps fun  glad Google is in the game	its not original  i already have facebook and twitter  what do i need google buzz for?	A future proof version of Twitter that will eventually link in with augmented reality Google Maps  Will be popular once average folk get it	It has just no added value for me  Totally unnecessary	Me too technology  what about Wave? Confusing & slow now	Its okay  Id be happier to see more levels of privacy as easy to implement as Facebook  But its nice in that its all plugged into the Gmail interface  Nice	Needs some work  Ill hold off for now	Buzzzz! Get me a fly swatter stat!	Trying to understand it but I like it	Buzz is messy and its still hard to find what Im looking for   Im giving them more time	Has great potential to rule the social networking world	no special reason to use it	not sure  Some I dont know who or why are following me  and I have no idea either how comes I follow people I dont know  lol  but quite funny so far	The Twitter feed isnt live; therefore  people are reading my 2pm tweet at 3 am	Intrusive  unrequested  redundant  Ill keep it (do I have a choice?) but its not very interesting	Its boring to look at and has an ugly interface  Getting Google reader updates is the worst	Not sure what problem I have the it solves	I like Buzz and I think well see a lot of improvements as we go along	Its a smart  strategic move on Googles part since it allows them to take advantage of their whole platform on Android handsets (duh)	Has advantages and disadvantages  chief among the advantages being such great integration with other google service	so far for me its no more than a kind of social backup tool  also dont like spamy privacy options	annoying/useless  a less user friendly and less attractive facebook wall	like all these social networks there is a learning curve but Buzz shows great promise still test driving and trying to collapse the overly long threads!	Prototype at best so far  Deleted it from Gmail after about a week   Will check back later to see if its more robust	It seamlessly works with the rest of my google stuff and the connections are savvy and helpful	I dont like it  It doesnt seem as user friendly or useful as other social media sites	I think it is the best of the social media outlets  :)	Too much content to sift through  not enough options for organization	The more I use BUZZ  the more I like it   Its SUPER!	So far Im using it a lot    looking forward to seeing where it goes	its too confusing   and its boring to scroll down to see so many comments and I hate my google inbox being flooded   I am a twitter fan as of now	I am finding it more compelling to use than Twitter	Being a social media g33k  Im hesitant to use it bc I already overload my friends networks across the board  Now info invasion in someones Gmail? Not OK	I am still trying to get used to it  But I am liking what I see so far  and I am sure that it will be improved	Like Google Wave  I think Buzz was released prematurely  Its not quite ready for prime time	Buzz is still new and a little slow so waiting to see how it evolves	I used it for about a week  and did not like it  Ive disabled it within Google email  I dont think that I will ever use it again  It is set up rather poorly q	Bad Start  Good Potential  Promising Future	Buzz allows you to share with people connected by What you Know rather than by the Who you Know of FB	Ive found buzz to be a nice promising alternative of facebook  but its still have a long way through	the best thing is see what your friends followers are talking in discussions	I like it but it gets kind of boring	Yet another half baked Google product like Wave  Can they stop thinking like programmers for a second and hire some real people?	I am liking the idea that I can share articles from my feeds to other users  The interface takes a little getting used to but its growing on me	Buzz: microblogging  blogging & conversation platform in one place  You call it HOME? maybe to some : )	Buzz  still rough around the edges  works well as a place to have actual conversations  Lots of nice grace notes  and improving daily	I like the idea of it how I can email  chat and tweet all in one window  but it feels 80% done and needs better privacy	Of all Googles recent innovations  Buzz is friendly   usable   truly interactive and useful out of the box	I had hopes for Wave  Buzz crushed my dreams	Dont really care one way or tother  Buzz   another social   zzz   media site  zzz   Im so excited   zzz   I can hardly stay awake   zzz   zzz   zzz   zzzzzzz	It has immense potential but for now its unwieldy & overwhelming   just like Google Wave  (yes  its still alive!)	The was never a need for Buzz  its just something else I have to empty now   Google  stick to search	The UX is weak and clunky  I find no real incentive to use it  and gmail is my primary email provider  So many other platforms do it better	I am indifferent to it  I have Twitter and Facebook already  Just another attempt at Googles takeover of the planet	I think it was a rush launch  Too much to improve	Like the integration w/ Gmail  Easier to share videos  photos & longer posts   Confident that Google will make improvements as they did with Gmail and Analytics	Useless !! It adds nothing since it relies a lot on existing services	More discussion oriented than any other social networking platform	It is very nice  but I would prefer a native iPhone & Mac application	Works for me: check out my take on the Buzz @ http://javier wordpress com	So far all my buzz is just a melting pot of other networks streams  Currently  all I find useful are the Mashable discussions	Can we create a conference room on it?	I dont like the UI   And since I dont use gmail  the tough UI makes me not even want to try to give it more of a shot  Ill stick with Twitter	Buzz is poised to take off in a big way   want Google to put the best  focus on this!	Obviously released into the wild a little prematurely  Needs lots of work	Just love all products from Google	I have been using it for several days and have been able to connect it to Facebook and Twitter  so my posts on Buzz can be seen there too  I am a HUGE fan!	Thinking about it    Im sure it will catch on but overtake others? Not sure; but then it IS Google!	I dont see how  in terms of value  its any diff  than using a mail list  except only to gmail users	Buzz is getting better  and thats a good sign  But it still has a lot of room for improvement  I dont think Google will let it die	Its good as a start but there alot of work needed	love it  its new and does need lots of work but im positive google will work out all the issues it has and make it a major player	Doesnt do anything that Twitter and Facebook dont  just another service to check lacking any original or special features (and some basic ones too)	its just so easy to use  but it would be nice to be able to use lists  because now its not very clear with all the posts in one big list	Talks about subjects that other people dont want or prefer us not to talk about  I appreciate the nice clean subjects  Nothing crude  either  Even corp s don	Still need a lot of work on the human interface level ( desktop client  more controls etc  )	Great potential for an internal comms tool in or company	I am a fan of Google apps  But since Google Wave I am getting disappointed  Google  please dont be anxious to serve us new untested products You can do better!	Interesting  powerful but messy (UI & all the stuff that has been discussed since the release)	whats the real use?	  Simple chat nice	Im still not seeing Twitter updates in Buzz  and am keeping Tweetdeck as my favourite location to track my social net feeds  Like Buzz ideal but still wk to do	Gmail contacts  Google Reader followers  Google Talk friends  Buzz followers  Latitude friends    all these contacts and settings needs centralised somewhere!	Thats what have been missing from gmail	I cant find a REAL use of it  since we already have Twitter and other services like it  GBuzz didnt bring anything new  and further more its very unorganized	Still needs work  but its a good start and its already in the most used web app the webmail   and google has already won there	I do not like that you can not shrink long buzz  with too many comments	Buzz  U need some extra stuffs similar to #	I like it   but it is just one more thing I need to remember to check  I definitely prefer the Buzz layout over Twitter though	The most social of the social tools currently available	go on it a lot but most of my friends dont have it so it gets a bit annoying	Its one of the best social networking websites Ive ever seen  Its just awesome as the concept of social networking and its linking with email is awesome!!!!	Once I had the time to configure groups to post to  it will be great to be able to filter to them:  its a much better version than that on Facebook	I adore Google Buzz and Ive already convinced 3 friends to join	But it needs improvement in the user interface	not so much right now  have hopes for it  It has potential	I like Google Buzz know I will like it when I understand it better havent used buzz much   ADD ms	I like google BUZZ  I am ON Google BUZZ	I love google buzz	like it  but theres still much to improve  many bugs =(	Great approach at social networking  Needs some improvement  but it is a new service  so Im looking forward for new features it will include in the future	It defeats the point of feed  which are concise bits of information that entice readers to dig deeper  Its a conversation ender not a starter	The integration of networking with email is awesome !	Finally  intelligent two way social communication	twitter is blocked in China while google enable us to keep in touch with the world buzz a new way of life	I love the social feed integration and hope this functionality continues to expand with additional services	Im sure its great  but as a Google Apps for Domains user I cant use it  Add to that the mess they made of authentication    Clean it up  Google!	Annoying & misses the point of micro publications that are a jumping off point for conversation that are also concise	Still not found a use for it   and when you follow more than a couple  you get lost  Facebook handles this sort of thing far better	Only suckage with mobile app is you cant attach pic to your buzz :/	I have to find out  This is the first time I see it  So   still unclear www flamingoservicesbonaire colm	It is too convenient not to love  especially for Google addicts	i love google buzz	its ok  hopefully will get better with time	Buzz bring me and my friends together; I would love this lifestream product if if were smart enough to distinguish between parallel RSS streams (in Beta?)	I hate people who never care abov their future Those who live as though theyll die only for today and never see tomorrow	hope it wont become a bluff	I used it a week  but seemed one of not that many    Twitter  facebook are simply too popular    Twitter already location aware and facebook will follow  march	It was stressing reading the number of unread buzzes under my inbox  It makes you feel like you MUST read them all  I rather go to Twitter when I feel like it	S A BEAUTIFUL IMPERFECTION WHICH BLUNDER DE CREATOR 2 DISCOVER IT	Nice  but with room for improvement  Given its immediate scale  however  I think people will find this a compelling complement to their social media addictions	Indifferent sums it up  Google trying to hit the social network but a failed attempt  Sorry Google	La verdad no me gusta mucho :S	dari sekian banyak produk Google  mungkin ini yang tidak kusuka	It feels awkward being all up in your email interface  Ive really tried to  but I just cant see email (professional social)  and microblogging as a couple	I like it better than twitter	Its good  but could be better   I dont get why they needed to make it if theres already Facebook  Twitter  etc   Its useful  though!	nice to use  good connected with gmail	Not sure of its potential yet  what makes it different from other social/media site   just redundant	nice feature for those who need to share something with their email pals but dont have any FB  Twitter  account etc	Easy to access  but a pain for trying to look through everything  Needs a better interface

IE6 a real fossil that proves how proprietary software and imperialistic corporate politics can undermine innovation and threat online security	I love the IE6 since it showed Microsoft its limitation as a former monopoly  They learned together with their customers that the web is open! And that is good!	Im a web developer and IE6 is the bane of my life! It had its day and served its purpose but its time to move on	what a load of shit  its only for idiots  like hotmail	@microsoft please give up work on IE and concentrate on the O/S  Firefox is the way forward	Still very much an archaic web browser as compared with the innovative likes of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome  Security flaws all over  It holds you back	Everything about it just feels old and clunky  The interface is pointlessly crowded and ugly  loading is slow  you cant close tabs without viewing the tab	IE 6 & 7 & 8 can all render the same thing differently  !@Â£$%	It sucks  IE 6 ruined the whole web; IE 7 was not better; IE 8     can not find any advantages on it  There are so many options for browsers  IE is not in them	Probably the worst  slowest web browser in human existence  Although its security may be adequate  its speed is atrocious  Google Chrome for the win	Fast browser with support for latest technologies  No longer supports some widely used technologies though	best browser on the market so far  megafast  newest html4 technology in it  Flash Support  comes right with windows :) ROFLMAO just kiddin	The worst browser    Firefox = FTW	Needs to disappear off the face of the earth  Period	worst ever  Unable to compete with other open source browsers  everything is flawed from bottom up	no where to compared with even chrome  speed	Why cant Microsoft make things that people actually will *want* to use?	Absolutely hate it  Too integrated w/OS (IE & Windows R synonymous) Slow  vulnerable and lacks support for 3rd party features	As a web developer  it only takes about 15 mins to make a functional website that works on a standard compliant browser  But getting it to run on IE takes hours	Worst  Browser  Ever  The kick in the head is that IE is integral to Windows operations  This piece of sh*t cant be deleted without making the OS unstable	Hate it! Why wont IE developers obey to the web standards?!	nothing new  5 years before firefox and chrome	In the time it takes to load Googles homepage on IE  I can load 10 websites on Firefox or Chrome  I dont have the time to deal with such a horrible program	Truly horrible  A reason not to like Microsoft	Supporting IE makes a Web Developers job a royal pain  Using IE makes the web surfers leisure a job	Terrible browser  Slow  cant handle the simplest tasks  everything just looks bad in IE	Needs more love  not as bad as they say	Really great features  I like the developer functions  But too unstable  Thats why I moved to Google Chrome	it has good functions without slowing down your computer more than the older verisions	Needs to be buried  never to return!	The bane of Web developers! IEs market share is only reflective of its use by so many computer owners that dont know the first thing about using computers	its perfect u can search anything u like on this	Like it!! Makes my jobs easier    Need to find out something  go for this!	The worst browser ever  bad javascript engine bad layout difficult to progrsm websites to work on  So it is bad in everything	Internet Explorer is good for one thing  going to Mozilla com to download Firefox	I avoid it like the plague	Slow  ugly  and no good features

336743	Feature filled  and the only software I would dream of using for organising my music and syncing my iPod  Sadly  its rapid growth has made it slightly slow	Now that they offer DRM free music  theyre all the better  Im not as much a music lover as a film geek  but I do appreciate iTunes while I work	The worst Apple product ever	Bloated with unneeded features  overall just sluggish compared to its competition  Almost seems like it was meant to be seen  not heard	i use  because i have too   not because i want to    interface is slow  upgrading to new versions and keeping everything in sync is always a gamble	i definitely choose this over win media player; and is likely the reason i am stuck to ipods  it has some annoyances  but they are good about the improvements	Love it and run all of my music through it	No no no    the worst music player / organizer Ive ever tried	seems awfully bloated but hey gotta synch my Ipod	Its good but  for me  its memory hungry and very slow!  I use it mainly for the sidekicks  Last fm and iLike sidebars	Very memory hungry  but essential for use with last fm  and my iphone	I really like iTunes  I know most hate having to pay but aside from that I love the fact that I can buy a cd at 3:15am and have it loud & clear in a minute	Love teh interface and its Limewire compatible  xD	The revolution started a few years back and is still light years ahead!	iTunes is nice   But I personally prefer Songbird	Its easy to use  and works with Last fm	Easy  simple  works	Best way to buy music	The hub of my digital life! The smart playlists  iTunes U and Podcast support makes this the go to app for all my listening related desires!	I dont enjoy when iTunes eats 1 of my 2GBs of ram  Only use it because there isnt much else for OS X	Even though it can get a little sluggish at times  its generally pretty good for listening to music and podcasts	There are some downsides (like being slow)  But its made for the iPhone and iPod   you cant beat it	Really nice  Could be made to run faster	It could run a bit more smoothly  but is otherwise nice	Large choice (music  videos  tv  podcast  apps) and DRM free  but still expensive	too heavy and bolted for windows   hope its better on a mac	best ever  Craps all over WMP  Easy  nice looking  etc	The perfect music library! Works brilliantly even with Windows  but once you get use it on the Mac   theres no going back!	what a crap for the one who doesnt own a i pod  heavy!	Great but slow at times  Apple needs to focus iTunes back on music before      cough  Spotify	I dont like the way it does it library  and its bloated	Great if you own an iPod because then all its extra features really shine  I like its overall performance a lot better than others like WMP and Winamp too	I wish there was more free things	The music store can be pretty slow but aside from that it works perfectly with my iphone and it keeps my music organized + Genius playlists are great	Excellent way to organize and listen to music and iTunes DJ lets my friends listen to what they like	Instant gratification to the nth degree	why cant I just   well just manage my music properly with iTunes? It sucks hard!	Just not good software	use it with www ilike com toolbar	iTunes on Windows is much better than many people say  Ive used it for years  even before I had an iPod  Shame about the odd niggle though	I like it  but not nearly as much as Songbird   Too bad I have to you iTunes for my iPod	I couldnt live without this  syncing to my I phone is done fast and easily and working it is hassle free if your using Wmp update to this  Youll love it!	Definitely reliable  but it seems really easy to end up with a library where you have 10 copies of the same thing  Could use a smart program to help>	Reliable  I really dont have any complaints  Might not be the most feature packed complex app  but works well for me	Heavy and greedy with system settings on Windows  Not worth the pain for me   Amazon MP3 + Foobar2000 does everything I need from a music store + player	Okay it works  But I am disgusted at the price rises on good songs! This just encourages illegal downloads! Greedy businessmen!	great tool for ipod	What a horrible piece of software to run on Windows   Apple as a company just leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth	Greate music player  itunes store is the bigest music/movies store  Appstore is also awesome	i have ipods   but it s always a boring process to upadate it   f  k	Im however still annoyed that Apple insist to use iTunes for most of their programs  Especially Apple tv  which is useless as long as i runs through iTunes	Proprietary piece of sh*t	While the intention may have been to share everything  the setup is tricky	Crashes to much  too slow  needs a makeover and more features	There are better more stable alternatives out there that will work on any OS you may have	Far too proprietary and makes file maintenance a nightmare  Songbird offers all the same functionality without the headache  and even more features	Daily user  Better design than WinMediaplayer and also easier in usage  Huge musicstore(!) ^^	Perfection of a Media Player	Proprietary  hard to use  bloated   nuf said	I use it and love it   they helped create the digital media revolution and I support that	Its a great media library organizer  There are some better apps out there  but this works best with my iphone/ipod	After reading the first few lines of the EUA I wont let it near my machine  Proprietary software of the worst kind  Since Spotify dont need it anyway	Lets say DRM  Im a FOSS guy  Im just lucky that theres libgpod	I havent used it too much yet  but so far I like it	I use it all the time to organize my music and apps for my iPod! Highly recommended player	I do appreciate having software thats up to date but   every time I reboot my computer? Little much  Also  stop mixing up my audiobook files!	Best way to buy music  TV shows  Movies  and audio books	Theres no other music store like iTunes Store  buying music has never been so simple  It also handles and plays the music and videos very well	See qeep com	iTunes is both user friendly and simple in layout  I like all of the different categories by which to organise my songs  in particular playlists and play count

336751	Im used to Firefoxs features and add ons  so Chrome feels too limited  Might do better on smaller devices like netbooks and Android phones than on the desktop	I still prefer Firefox  and Im waiting for Linux support  but its OK  Each tab and plug in as its own process is a great idea as processors get more cores	This has become my web browsing work horse  The create application feature is fantastic  especially with webapps like Mibbit  Pandora  Gmail  Google Docs	Well I like Google and all    but the browser is in its infancy as of yet  When it matures a bit more  perhaps it will make me switch from Firefox!

Its fast and my default browser  but I use it with Firefox    there are some extensions I really like there   Also Chrome seriously needs bookmark all tabs	Love The Mac Version of Google Chrome!

Its simple  fast  and powerful	Too many pages it cant load while firefox hasnt got a problem with the same pages e g  facebook  Pity though  it is definitively the faster one	Im happy with Firefox  nothing in Chrome makes me want to change	I liked it  but I cant use it without extensions	Has a lot of potential  but needs add ins at the very least  even then it is just getting close to Firefox	the speediest & secure Browser ever   if its support firefoxs addons then it will the best browser ever   with out addons i cant Ditch Firefox	Ill love it when it gets extensions    but will it still be speedy?	Fast  beautiful to look at and would be my preference   IF they ironed out compatibility issues (XStandard eg) and IF it had plugins	Read the fine print    no more privacy!	I prefer Chrome for speed  gears for offline apps and bookmarklets instead of add ons  Simply better and faster	i love it  but i really miss all the firefox add ons that simplify my life	Its quick but needs more features	Its versatile  easy to use & implement  it has embedded applications that will project it well into the future and more importantly  it outstrips IE totally	Fast and clean  very simple  very good :)	I prefer Firefox  but Chrome is a nice alternative	Lightning fast  does exactly what you need  and gets out of the way	Its simple and pretty fast  but needs add ons  I dont understand why it has no built in Google support though (e g  Google bookmarks)!?!

Awful Support	Just tried it  works like a charm but its a bit slow  Theres a comparison of Jungle Disk and CloudBerry over at http://bit ly/gkyS7	So far  its great  That said  I havent had to do a restore  But you can map the cloud space as a drive  so direct file access shouldnt be a problem

Nice features  but a bit bulky as far as the interface   and the mozilla underpinnings just dont seem the same as FF to me  Its much slower than FF	Flock 3 5: Fugly interface  huge tabs  bad UX when searching for add ons on their site  and doesnt put the default browser back the way it found it	If you are at all involved with social networking  especially facebook & twitter  you must check out this browser  Its a quick setup as a spinoff of Firefox!	flock is a social version of firefox! it is the ideal browser if you are into social networking!	flock really improved over the last years  meanwhile its really fun to use! but there are still some issues to be worked out	The same features that I loved in Firefox with the integration of my goto social media platforms   It has also taken the place of my feed management tool	Luv this browser!!  It has its own news reader and cant beat for social intergration	Tooth meltingly fast  great for social networking and keeping up to date with feeds and news  Flock has now replaced Firefox as my favourite browser	Tried it before a year and liked it that time	Mozilla based  fast  functional with the best built in RSS reader Ive seen so far  Very well integrated social networking and media browsing	is currently using this browser	good browser but still underground	Its the browser I use for everyday use  Its about the best for keeping track of all your social networking crap	The best browser for networking with superb features	The best and only browser that integrates social media as well as apps into one easy to use browser	Though just a mod of Firefox  I dont like it    just get firefox and stuff	Good browser   Its not Chrome   ok   but   good!	Blipping from Flock  Seems cool! Staying in touch on Facebook  Twitter  etc  and see whats going on: really cool! But I think its gonna be boring at the end	Tons of Web 2 0 features  but its a bit bulky	A web browser that aggregates all your various social networking identities into one place for easy reference  Web 2 0 to the max	i love the media bar and the email notification	Like the My World tab  but could be faster as a browser	Nice but slow   Also I wish it ran on webkit instead of gecko	Nice idea and pretty well executed  But I personally do not like the feel of it  its also kind of cluttered	think google has been cutting edge from the stat There is no telling were and how far the amazing TEH is going to go I want to be and know everything there is	Its rather slow  and the interface is ugly and cluttered	Its ok genius idea execution not to great  The platform is unstable slow and is(in stock form) bloated

337023	The best multi protocol IM I have used	Great featureset  but feels relatively unpolished and eats up a ton of RAM  I still use it for the time being  but Im shopping for a replacement	Ive never had a good experience with pidgin  or its predecessor GAIM  Memory hog and GTK base makes it somewhat unstable on windows  Digsby is a better bet	Great chat software    Always use it on Ubuntu	Good  clean interface  now mostly free of bugs   I have used it for years	Probably the best multi protocol IM client Ive used  Clean  easy to use  and a low memory footprint	A bit more rough around the edges than I like  Functional  but thats about it	neat   clean   free   small   portable also available   easy   also notifies about mail	A very functional multiple instant messenger account chat client worth having!	The best  And its open source	Digsbys the better bet  More usable  less resources eaten up	Lovely on ubuntu desktop	In my opinion the best application for getting around various IM networks ever  Light  simple  supports almost every protocol  9/10	I like it on my Linux machines	Its a very handy app  I added on the Facebook  Skype  and Twitter plugins to make it support ALL my protocols	Brilliant multi protocol IM software  It just works!

337481	Good variety of games  decent prices in the US  but DRM is annoying and customer support is atrocious	Convenience is king  Ive bought more games through Steam than Ive ever bought in a store  and the weekly sales are a huge plus	Like all the useful things Ive come across  Steam was introduced to me by my brother  Useful for hopelessly addicted TF2 gamers	Day of Defeat and Team Fortress 2  Two amazing mindless shooters that you could play for hours	Exactly like Xbox Live but for PC  Buying a game is only a couple of clicks away  Pricey games in Europe due to 1 euro = 1 dollar conversion though	Such a good platform and community	Many games available for purchase   Decent prices and weekend  plus doliday deals   Automatic game updates   Online games backup available   No native o	Good gaming platform that likely demonstrates the future of digital distribution gaming	I bought Total war which is a great game in the past  By the time i jumped thru all the hoops with steam  I could not play the damn game  There is no one to cal	A pretty good game distribution platform  maybe the best one available  Buying and managing games is easy  It also often has good discounts of popular games		
338321	Takes some time to get used to when moving from iTunes  Requires some extra installation tricks on Ubuntu 9  All in all  its the best on Linux	Amarok seems to figure out what songs I like	Linux media center	I use it daily :)		
336813	Mac OS X isnt as perfect as everyone likes to make out  but its the best OS Ive used so far  Now Ive gone Mac  Im not going back	The best OS you can get   Once you try it  youll never go back to Windows  Ever	Best app ever! :)	This is changed my life! Just so natural to use	The best desktop OS in the world  And snow is coming  Great fight between Microsoft and Apple is just beginning :)	It is an amazing step up from Tiger    The reference OS	Yes! Just yes	Powerful  elegant  intuitive  effective  Apple!	Leopard runs like a champ on my iMac 24 <3	Best combination of high level polish and low level access	Probably the best operating system I have ever used  and Im comparing it to Windows 2000!  Highly recommended  but dont impulse upgrade if you have Tiger 10 4	Fantastic OS  still some small niggles  but wouldnt swap it for the world!	Theres just nothing else you can compare it too! Runs beautifully  looks brilliant  I just have nothing bad to say!	Itll keep me over until Snow Leopard	Very stable  intituive  love it until Snow Leopard :D	Simple and Elegant   This is a fantastic operating system with far more capabilities and built in features than XP or Vista while also being much more stable	Perfection! I recently switched over from Windows & my stress level is down  plus I have stopped yelling at inanimate objects! It works and looks good doing it	I love Mac OS  i think much better then Windows	You caught me I am a Mac lover	Looking forward to Snow Leopard :)	A very different workflow to Windows and Ubuntu  but everything is so much simpler and theres no messing around in the system if you dont want to  Also  BSD	OSX FTW!! Come on  you still want to get jail in that little Windows?	You love it or you hate it  Well  I hate it  Though I have to give Apple credit for being able to market their products so successfully	Amazing  though some apps hog up system resources  Will be improved by Snow Leopard aka 10 6!	I am using it and I really love it  Its clean & clear  easy to use and very productively	This is definitely a move in the right direction toward intuitive interfaces	As usual Apple thinks far ahead with good intentions not just profit in mind	Good one   but soon its gonna be Snow Leopard!	Love the space bar preview option as well as spaces  Helps keep a clean desktop  Its wonderful!	Some people love the UI    I think its too simply and annoying	Easy  Integrated  Fresh  Innovative  Most importantly  very few hassles	It only works on Macs  which is a shame	Dont know the reason but I love using this OS	Yep  smooth  awesome    what else do you want haters? (Plus Im a dedicated Windows User :D)	The best OS until Snow Leopard	Id like to have one    :( Ive tried and is so         so!!!	Cant see much of the difference but love it!	Usability! Stability! Design! Like Linux  but with Adobe CS (:	Only used it recently and so far so good  not perfect but hell what is  Looking forward to trying a little snow with it though	So many features and is very simple to use	I dont like it  Im too get used to Windows way of doing things	Excellent leap from Tiger  Being built on BSD kernel makes it easy to port *nix apps  Greatest stability of mainstream OSs	Apple is my favorite brand  seriously	Anytime I dont think I like OS X  I think of Windows and shutter	Leopard was the major change  so Snow Leopard is the icing on the cake  Minor refinements to a high quality OS	love the new expose	switched to Snow Leopard month after its out  Cant complain too much   way way better then Redmond products  thats for sure  Not goin back there ever	Switched from Windows    Like night and day  How do people put up with Microsoft?	Its better than Windows but no so good as Linux	Great O/S  looks good  runs good : ) keeps me happy	Wonderful! The most elegant operating system in the world!	Looks super nice	Definitely worlds most advanced operating system and its even sleek sexy and easy to use	Like all other Apple software  this might work well in its own little world but has poor integration with everything else		
336812	Unlike most people  I didnt have a single problem with Vista for the entire time I used it  I prefer Mac OS X  but Vista is still a nice OS to use	I think Vista has gotten a bit of a bum rap  Ive never had any real problems with it  UAC takes a bit of getting used to  but overall Vista is a good OS	Digital Restriction Management  Arduous menu system  Painfully slow  Vista? Yup	I still cannot get used to it   it is not user friendly or at least it is not friend with me ! :D	Its not horrible  It doesnt have some of the problems it did at first  but I still dont like some of the interface changes	You blipped vista!    cancel or allow   ? :|	Windows Vista  it not a big success	Come on man  Its cool windows that Im using right now  since 98	There is a reason  as to why I prefer Firefox over Vista: The former is a helluva more faster than the latter	Im not sure why everyone harps on it  It works  its secure  its fast (Im on 64 bit) and its windows  which has 100x more apps than Mac/Linux	Its got its critics but I like it  Most stable version of Windows Ive personally used   Just wished it was faster   Windows 7 looks nice though	I dont have words to describe its suckyness   Simply put: its the worst software engineering from Microsoft so far	Vista is a pretty unstable and buggy Operating System that is aggravating to use	I put like but I was torn  I think its OK  I got the newer version of Vista which had some bugs fixed  But when Windiws7 is avaible  I will instantly upgrade	haha this is the reason i own a mac lol	Post SP1 Vista is very usable  but as many others I am waiting for Windows 7	F@ck the  Micro$oft Tax  shittest things on the Computer world   Ballmer this for u [  |  ] Ubuntu will eat u  Fat Bu$terd  :P now do the Monkey Jump Again :P	I dont see why everyone hates Vista so much  Ive been using it for ages  and its almost identical to XP  but with a few tweaks  Roll on Windows 7 though  ;)	Vistas chrome is great and all  but it slows the computer so much that Im going to downgrade to XP soon	weak system  windows 7 beta were more stable than the final version of Vista	What can I say I converted to Linux Ubuntu over a year ago and havent looked back	If Microsoft hadnt invented Windows there would be no war  famine or disease  : )	A decent OS  but dont even bother installing this on a Netbook  get XP or 2000 instead	I got a new laptop  was completely anti Vista  I can stand it(4 GB ram  it works)  but I dual boot Ubuntu  and would really rather have Mac OSX or at least XP	Blahhh  I want my next OS to use 2 gigs of Ram not just one	Thought it would be good turned out to be terrible with constant crashes and terrible functionality  An appalling Os I want a MAC!	It drives me crazy  Its slow and doesnt manage your downloads as well as xp  It doesnt let you open certain folders for unknown reasons  Get xp or a mac	Slow and buggy    but surprisingly better than XP	A few good features but mostly just major bloatware  i went straight back to XP	Vista is the most stable OS Ive ever used  Ive encountered far more problems with XP than I have with Vista  Nvidia and Creative be damned  Vista is solid	Utter crap  unstable  incompatible  get Windows 7 now  Much more solid	Never had a problem with it  Dont know why all you people are complaining about it	Its good  not as good as windows 7  not even close	OK and decent  but I think Ubuntu is a bit better	Windows vista is a fuck up by a fucked up company	Screw proprietary software  Screw Microsoft  Screw Windows  But Vista is of another world  Security is a joke  it has compatibility issues  and its slow as hel	What a nightmarishly sluggish buggy OS   I dont like to pull my hair out	Some of the problems in Vista I just cant stand! Other than a few big problems  it is alright	+ looks better than XP   problems with software and drivers   buggy   slower than XP & Seven	one word: DOG  man this had to be the worst product produced out of Redmond  GUI only thing decent   but poor poor performance; ditched returned to XP!	I liked Windows before this  Used it my entire life  I loved XP  But    Vista was the worst thing to ever happen to this world  [:	I love the new software stack  and it feels more real worldly   finally a MS OS I can sink my teeth into!	Slow  buggy  old  ugly	Lousy  Everyone keeps XP or skips it to 7	Would you like to run Firefox?  Cancel or Allow  Would you like to download OpenOffice?  Cancel or Allow  So annoying   And Vista is slow and buggy	Works well  most of the complaints I see from people areOMG IT IS DIFFERENT FROM XP! and WHY DOESNT IT WORK ON THIS OLD COMPUTER? but it works fine	Windows Vista was not  as most think  a bad OS  Released too early  perhaps  but the negative opinions are mostly driven by users with under spec hardware	ive had vista since it first came out  and havent had any problems with it yet the xp interface was just CHEESEY	I used this OS for a couple years and never suffered the problems other people did	Not Microsofts best OS  XP and Windows 7 both out classed Vista

After years of random crashes and wasting huge chunks of days fixing problems that then fix themselves for no reason  mac OSX is like a godsend	A piece of shit OS that severely lacks stability  It is very poorly put together and lacks useful features	Cant live with it  cant live without it  Although Windows 7 is two big fat thumbs up	Despite the fact that mac fan boys have trouble compensating for their lack of directx and smaller software catalog  windows remains superior	i do everything on my windows computer   gaming  homework  you name it  mac suks		
337112	Great extension  Im really  really digging the multiple rows of tabs  since I tend to have something like 30 open at any given time	Great extension even if I only use it for adjusting how mouse clicks work	I used to use this to make all new window links open in new tabs  but its included in Firefox now  Was useful back in the day  though	A must have for Firefox users  though I use Chrome now  ; )	A great add on  kudos		
337231	Best thing about Twitterrific is the bird sounds it makes that annoy the hell out of anyone in the room with you  Priceless amusement!	i think they have done a great job with the new version  hope they integrate @tweetphoto soon ;)	Did a personal review on this  screenshots included =) http://hueyyei posterous com/tweetie vs twitterrific showdown	My new favorite Twitter app  Period  Takes the place of Tweetie  Interface really is slick  It can only keep getting better! Good job IconFactory	The 2 features its missing from Tweetie is its not able to view following/followers and cant zoom in on profile pics!	One of the top 2 Twitter iPhone Apps: neck & neck with Tweetie	Really awesome after the latest update  A must have for iPhone	I agree with vincentpjimenez that the only thing lacking from making this outstanding is the inability to view following/followers  But I bet it will soon!	One of my favorite apps  alongside Twitterfon	Best twitter app on my iPhone	Beautiful design overall but also probably one of the best Twitter apps out there  The location feature also updates to your town rather than coordinates	My most used app on my Iphone  the best portable twitter application by far  colourful and user friendly	Used to be good  But the ads and price tag spoil the fun	Fine if you follow just the people that you really care of	Ok    ive said this enough    If you want to know what i mean  look at my previous stuff about twitter	By far the best Twitter app for iPhone	Nice App  easy to handle	Not bad for a twitter client	yeahhh stop reaning not bad for twitter app	Ive never liked the look of this app  It makes things more complicated than they should be	I used this for some time then tweetie2 came along  would go revert back if it had options for custom urls and custom image upload locations like tweetie	Cannot find a means to follow my Lists ! What am I missing ?

337590	I would be lost without this app  It has made life so much easier not only for storing passwords  but for having strong passwords	Many people dont understand what this app does at first  but once you figure it out and start using it regularly youll never want to surf the web without it	I dont know how I logged into websites before this program  Developers are constantly improving it too!	Indispensable  although the UI feels a little clunky for some reason	Very handy  especially some site which always force you to change passwords in a fixed period of time	This was the greatest thing I added to my life last year!  I agree with many others when I say that this is one of the first apps that I install on a new mac	Im its biggest fan :)	Got this when it was free  amazing tool for storing your password if you easily forget them!	Extremely useful on my Mac and on my iPhone		
336808	Launchy has completely changed the way I navigate my computer  Alt+Space brings up launchy  and I start typing  The Command Line meets Starship Enterprise	Great Launcher application	Great little app!	I use it all the time  Very good	Remind me   why are there icons on the desktop? and whats the start menu for? Oh  right  some people dont use launchy	windows start button search  but better	great way to get around your PC quickly	Its learning capabilities for auto completion are great!	I really love Launchy   I dont use it  though   It seems that I always forget to use it   I think that the Vista search works find  so I save the disk space	This is awesome    spotlight but 1000000% better	Like quicksilver  great for all your app needs :) works really well	One of my favorite application launcher	I like it but I have Google desktop and it basically does everything this application does  Ill play around with a bit more over time  Good so far though	Used to use it a lot  but replaced it with Everything Search Engine		
336804	An Adobe AIR twitter app that does everything  and does it well  Except for memory management  This app can really cause an older computer to crawl	Its really recommend for twitter junkies/crazies who have huge number of friends  Its looks bit professional with quite impressive features	Easily my favorite Twitter client   Love being able to sort my followers into columns for easier conversations	Relatively new user  but it has changed the way I use Twitter   Twitter should buy this application and make it their own!	I really like TweetDeck  but wish it didnt slow down my desktop	Great app    just need to cut down on RAM usage a bit	I use TweetDeck as my main twitter client  But  the only problem is that it uses a lot of API requests (Which is pretty much refreshing Twitter)	Tweetdeck and I have a love hate relationship	TweetDeck is impeccably designed and SO useful  Obsessed with the groups feature  It uses a lot of memory  though	A solid desktop Twitter app   I may look a little dry  but its very useful once you get used to using it	I set it up but its tough to keep up with it  I like the concept  I need to spend more time with it	Im not a huge Twitter user but not really liked this app	Lots of options and control for all Twitter accounts	@tweetdeck : The best Twitter app available  Cross platform too  which is nice  If only it could handle multiple accounts	The best twitter desktop app	I used to be vehemently opposed to this desktop consuming Twitter client  now I cant live w/o it ;)	I dont know how I could even still do Twitter without TweetDeck   It is great for organizing everything and sifting through tweets	Its okay  and looks nice at face value  but after a while I think the style is a bit overwhelming and it can become confusing to use	A bit of a resource hog  but extremely useful for reading twitter feeds  It sometimes has memory leaks and has to be restarted to make it work properly	Nice if you want to read a large number of tweet  But its memory hungry  like many AIR applications	Dont use it as much as I could  but this is a solid piece of software for Tweeters	I dont use it anymore  but its okay  Not my favorite	Great software even in beta! TweetDeck gives Twitter an IM like interface with alerts and a slew of features including translating tweets!	TweetDeck is awesome  Its the application I go to for my main Twitter account  I had to use something else for two days and realized how much I depend on it	Its what Im using now  but theres definitely some awkward niggly issues that need ironing out before I commit to it	Best desktop Twitter app  Good tip: create a Mashable column in TweetDeck for easy news reading	its great  except would like to add more columns & track conversations better like on Tweetie	This is definitely a good twitter app  though there are a few bugs here & there with the 12 seconds recording etc   Highly recommended all in all	Its an OK app  but it tends to get in the way  If it ran in the menu bar instead of the dock  and didnt quit when you closed the window  Id probably use it	Been using TweetDeck for a while now  Love the way it allows for columns  Wish it allowed for multiple twitter accounts  though	I do love the app  Wish there were a few more features  but its still a love	Yeah  TweetDeck is the best desktop Twitter application  Take full advantage of all the features (groups  search  link shortening  TwitPic & more)	I now see Twitter in a whole new way!	Amazing app  the columns feature is great!	Use it nearly everyday for easy grouping of different types of contacts  Retweeting and url shortening is a breeze	tweeting made easy!!! =)	I choose tweetdeck when I choose to twitter	Easy to use and with lots of functionalities  I love the seach columns	Very clean  cool  easy to use app   A bit of a learning curve at first but not bad   Like the recent Facebook integration	it is great  and even better it has facebook integration!	Great functions but absolutely pig ugly	I think that the new one is even better for Mac OS X and for updating Twitter and if you have it Facebook! Follow me @cp123!	Scary installation warning: Publisher Unknown  System Access Unrestricted  Can I trust that it wont put my computer at risk??	Twhirl is WAY better	I have it open 24/7 on my desktop  Do I need to say more about how much I love it ;)	My no  1 choice for desktop twittering	Fairly smart  and the best twitter desktop client I have found  But lots of kinks that need ironing out  and of course its based on Adobe Air	I like it but it crashes on me all of the time	pretty cool to segregate and vice versa	allows me to organize twitter! create groups  search and integrate Facebook  love it!	I love how I can get Twitter and Facebook friend updates in one application  Now  Ill really be addictive to both  :)	Seesmic Desktop is waaaay better!	Best way to manage  create  and send tweets	probably the best way to manage tweets and track tags in the twitterverse	stable  streamlined  feature rich management of tweets only limited by twitters own API  seamlessly integrates other services  too	Just installed this past weekend  but already have promoted it at a conference I attended	Awesome desktop Twitter client!	Tweetdeck makes sense of Twitter  Create groups from search alone makes this a must for tweeters	I love it!  Absolutely the easiest way to keep track of tweets: dm  reply  all  etc   its a cool app  one I cant do without	TweetDecks way too busy to use as my main Twitter client  Its great for monitoring Apple keynotes  though	Best way to organize Tweets   Love the notifications and love the different features ie  Shorten URL	works really well to aggregate all my twitters	Awesome! I can use the same AIR app on Linux  OS X and Windows	easy to use  multiple panels at once  a little buggy at times	The best way to get your twitter and facebook updates & keep them organised  The layout is simple & clear  you can create groups & it has useful link shortner	Does just what its supposed to do!	TweetDeck makes me feel like Im at the controls of a futuristic spaceship  and that delusion makes TweetDeck awesome  Sorting people by group is hot  too	Great for tweeting and keeping on top of your friends  The replies tab is slow at updating though	Best twitter app bar none	You cant reply to Facebook statuses    the only thing wrong with it!	its a very nice and customizable desktop twitter application  and it has facebook integration as well	was ok  a lot more powerful than other apps  but I found it a little bit unreliable at times  so for me it comes in second behind twhirl	Only been using it a short while  but seems okay so far	2 Thumbs Up it keeps you organized 2!	Awesome app  5 Stars!!!	Awesome         Great      Only so many words to describe how good it is!	im more browser based so i dont use that much yet i like how you can view everything at once	Fantastic app  Keep it running all the time and can just take a quick glance every now and then to keep up to date with my friends tweets	Using this on both OS   Great ap that always notifys you if something interesting happening in the network	its a great application to view twitter profiles and view twitter messages	Very nice  adjust API or youll dink out all the time	I love having all the info in one location	Revolutionised my Twitter experience  Occasionally a little buggy  but generally reliable and does the job well  Lots of nice features	Its making my life a lot easier	I dont use Twitter enough to need this app  but it sure looks pretty	Cant tweet without TweetDeck  Organizes and makes sense of my Twitter life	I would love it if I could have more than one account on it  but otherwise TweetDeck works really well for me	I still want it to have (many) more toys and functionality  and support many more services	I would not be on twitter with out tweetdeck! Wat easy and way cool	its awesome and makes Twitter all the better!	You right    is the best app for twitter =0)	I use it every day! Groups are the best way to keep track of who youre following	My favourite Twitter app  makes my life easier and less chaotic :D	handy for sifting thru tweets	Its really great! I love using it and helps me to see what I need to reply to right away and keeps everything separate  I cant say enough good things about it	I have to admit  this is a really nice tool for twitter  though most useful if you follow too many people and twit too much	Good  but i prefer Seesmic Desktop	Good  is very usefull and handy!!	Best Twitter App ever  wished I had an iPhone so I could have TweetDeck everywhere I go!	I pretty much use this app solely when Im not on my iPhone	With version  26 I can honestly say its nearly perfect   Let me reply to facebook and add plurk support and Im sold forever	I think this is the best Twitter client the supports multiple accounts and has a Group feature	Maybe its because AIR apps dont feel right on the Mac  maybe its because its overloaded and clunky    I guess its useful to Twitter power users maybe	i dont know enough about it to judge   thats whats wrong w/this country   everyone asks us to judge even though we dont have valid experience for it!!	Love the new version	tried some of the others  but came back to TD   love the groups function  being able to call up individual profiles  Excellent appl  use it everyday	I love the interface  Very user friendly	great tool   cant manage twitter without it!	My favorite twitter client for the desktop	Best app even with the memory leaks    this is the best browser of Twitter and the more Twitter tools they integrate the better	Air version = love  iPhone version = hate  Average = like	Easily my favourite desktop Twitter client  The iPhone version is good  but not quite up to Tweetie yet	It is THE BEST twitter client for desktops for heavy twitter users  Supreme functionality & constant innovation make it awesome  It is also one of best AIR app	getting better by the day	even beter now with multi account suppport =)	Cool app! Nice features missing in others clients (eg: filters)	Good but I have to tweak it massively on my eeepc 701  I use it on my desktop  still deciding between Tweetdeck and Seesmic for dominance on my pc	great for organizing your tweetness	easy to use easy to view!!	made tweeting with 2 accounts better!	The best client ever for Twitter	A MUST have for all Twitter ers	The best client Ive tested	Handy  but not very sleek  Good for tweet categorisation	Overall its a pretty solid Twitter app	Ive settled on it as my preferred Twitter client  Works great; my biggest gripe is that its built on AIR  and tends to be resource heavy  Great featureset tho	Great twitter client  very well organized  I do wish the notifications actually displayed the tweet though	Great! This application supports the multi OS(windows  mac  linux)  Furthermore  the Sync function is the best	Always have it running  and it manages my Twitter and Facebook accounts  I get everything in very close to real time  which helps when following over 100 people	TweetDeck rocks   Its flexible  customizable  helps you organize the tweets you follow  and it happens to be beautiful and cross platform	Starting to get used to it    love all the features it has  I can rock with it! DestroyTwitter is still my favorite!	With TweetDeck on both the desktop & iPhone it is hands down the most effective client for accessing Twitter	Good    but AIR   slow  no native look etc  Gwibber the best!	The web is just better  Id rather open firefox to check my tweets than TweetDeck  I cant see other peoples profiles nor click links to quickly see whats ne	Its a great client for Twitter  I personally use it  but hate its Facebook support	I used to love it  but got notififcation to update and the new one SUCKS  Gimme back old version  please	For twitter  it is the top  but unfortunately  as in my many other reviews  im not a big twitter person	Heres an easy way to update Twitter  Facebook and MySpace in any combination from your desktop	Free  easy to use   syncs with iPhone	Best way to utilize Twitters features in one place	Muy buena app!! aparte de la portabilidad de  estar hecha en Air! genial!	I personally prefer using Tweetie when on my mac   But I love using TweetDeck on my iPod!	Most useful Twitter app because it has so many options   searches  directory  customized columns and more  Only thing lacking: ability to schedule tweets	Such a space hog! Twhirl at least sits in the corner all nice and tight  TweetDeck has nice functionality but I hate that I need a whole monitor dedicated to it	like captain kirk on the flight deck!	I wasnt a big fan of Twitter until I started using TweetDeck	Gives a better overview over your Tweets than Twitter does	If social networking and twitter are your thing  TweetDeck is the best application for you  The best in its class	Yah I mean Ive tried it but its to I dont weird for me with odd funcations that dont seem to have a real place kind of a mess but still a bit worth while	I love it I stay on it the whole time Im online  You dont have to use the web and have a tab open to keep up with Tweets	the best twitter client!!!	I am just learning to tweet   Great App	only downside is Adobe Air	my always online program	Amazing app! I use it all the time!	Still my go to when looking for all round functionality  Some are catching it up (Seesmic!) but not quite there yet	really useful  better than the twitter website  i can @reply  retweet and even comment on my friends facebook status	Customizable and has many functions like uploading to TwitPic straight from the app	No StudiVZ  but a good application	Of the Twitter apps Ive tried  I like this one the most  Great features  Runs great on Mac and on my iPhone	Good app  havent found anything better but havent look either as Im happy with it  Id recommend it	easy to use and keep up with my fav tweeps like @jansimpson @obama @oprah	Multiple Twitter accounts  Facebook  LinkedIn  many options of organizing   perfect! I just have it open all day in the background as a window to my friends	a mainstay twitter app that keeps getting better and better  would love to see more multi user management tools like tasking  notes  etc	Just starting out with tweetdeck	Aplicativo muito bom para quem usa muito o Twitter  inclusive profissionalmente  Recomendo	It is the way one cant be stumped when one is on a good wicket	Pretty good twitter desktop app  Love it	Very good Twitter app for Linux and Windows	An excellent Twitter App only let down by the fact it runs on the AiR platform which is terrible	I like tweetie better for both iphone and mac   Tweetdeck just looks dirty	Use it a good amount from the desktop   Posting to FB not always clean resulting in multiple posts	I think tweetdeck rocks it is amazing	Cant make my mind up some times I love it some times I hate it    so for now I will just Like it =)	I wish it supported Korean language  I might use it more then  Otherwise  its a great way to keep up with Twitter  Im glad they support Twitter lists	Its very good  but it uses waaay too  much ram	http://www anchoi8x co cc Hot sexy girl Viet Nam Show hang tu suong  scandal sock 9x	Best client for tweeting  facebooking and get all infos from these services  But they have still to do many things	Couldnt make it work in Ubuntu Linux AMD64  I like the interface but was impossible to install  Its not Adobe AIR  DestroyTwitter works http://bit ly/bkItxi	Use it everyday   normally it works perfectly  but sometimes it can be having a bad day and take forever to load	Its pretty good  Used to use it but using Hootsuite now	I liked it a lot at first  but now I tend to use web based twitter client such as Seesmic web	Awesome  its what i use the most for twitter  awesome integration of bit ly and twitpic	It is an excellent Twitter client for being free but using it as a Facebook client is basically impossible	TweetDeck is AWESOME!  The iPhone/iPod version has some bugs and the Facebook connectivity needs some UI help but other than that    GREAT!	I tried other desktop clients but tweetdecks help & streams made tweeting much more enjoyable	Totally useless   Looses all state information if exited		
336924	Pandora used to provide an excellent service  After using Last FM  Ive come to decide that Pandoras library is far too limited	A extremely useful and enjoyable website that plays songs based on what you like   I love it  couldnt survive without it	Amazing  Just amazing   Make your own personal radio station of only music	An amazing app  Finds all the music you like  You can listen to your friends stations  Totally cool	Brilliant  I found LOTS of new music with this   I just wished it worked outside of the US again  : (	incredible easy to use web app that makes it easy to listen to your favorite types of music all day long	It plays a lot of repeated songs  but its excellent when I dont have my own music with me on hand	make your own station that you can teach	Great way to discover new music  Especially great when used with last FM  with the mashup pandoraFM	Awesome for discovering new music	Its excellent  it really is till they decided not to broadcast any more in Europe    1 year later and they still havent sorted the licensing!	My favorite site to use when I feel like discovering awesome new music	Loved it till they closed the service for users outside the US	the BEST   and only one I know of where you can put in a SONG not just an artist	Only available in the US   what about the rest of the world	Rumour has it that there is a world outside of the USA	I love Pandora  Adore it  Its sad that it doesnt seem to work outside the US anymore  because it is awesome	Pandora is okay  but  IMO  it doesnt play good songs from artists and repeats tracks too much  Stations burn out fast  I prefer Slacker Radio (www slacker com)	its only a US thing so why should we care ?	use it all the time on my pc and iphone   great variety of music to fit any mood	i listen to pandora at work  :D	Its not available in Canada! :( :(	Last fm is better  But Pandora would be in 2nd place:	Seb turned me on to Pandora	Loving the new Pandora ONE   Nice desktop app   Pop up window displaying each song is a great addition	Amazing recommendations  nice and simple  Blows last fm out of the water  All about the music	A revolutionary way to find and listen to new songs based on the music that you like  Runs slow on my computer  but with 256mb RAM  everything does	Pandora is the best! I have discovered new bands here and I can listen to the groups I already like	Great way to sample new music	Pandora was the original music discovery thing  and its still on a roll	Pandora is what the Internet should be all about  giving each user exactly what they want	Also in my Top 5  Dont like that you can only fast forward so many times  but by creating a new station you can get around that  Great suggestions	One of the best  It has saved me from work on many a day	Being able to design my own radio stations is rad  its nice for getting to know new music in similar genres	i dislike that i can use it in Russia	Helped me rediscover old favorites and discover some new ones  Easy to use and runs smoothly on various browsers	Sucks  Cant use it outside the US  Thats as lame as Hulu	I never would have found some of the bands I now call my favorites without this site	its simply amazing except for the part that you only get 40 hours a month for free  i blow out the 42 hours in less then 4 days	itz reealy cool  u can just relax while on it	Its a great way to listen to music youre pretty certain youll like  but there can be a lot of restrictions if you arent signed up	Love it & love it more now that theres a Blackberry app for it	I like the interface on Last Fm way better  Pandora has to many interuptions  Last Fm has a nice media Layout	I like Pandora  but the free accounts are annoying	awesome free app   everyone needs this if you have an iPhone/iPod touch	But the whole music thing is such a commodity  There are a zillion ways to be close to music  but the quality of music being put out leaves much to be desired :	Its a great way to mix any combinations of music and not get bored with hearing the same thing day in  day out  Buy the service and go commecial free	Awesome   Better than last fm?  I dunno  too close to say	Last fm is too random especially on a mobile device  Their selection is too limited AND Last fm does not stay within your desired genre very well	The best music site on the web!	Great music site!	I love Pandora Radio its the best!!!!	I somewhat like Pandora radio  but I was referred here from Avatar Pandora  lol	Best app ever! I love Pandora  Its the best!!!	Genius  How did I ever get my all night research papers done without this?	I use it daily :)	I prefer last fm for its ability to bring in information (plays  hearts  etc ) from other services  but Pandora is good too	Pandora has been going strong for several years and is still one of the best internet apps ever! Love Pandora!!

393174	Its definitely more impressive than originally thought  but layout and ui is in need of some improvement	UI looks ugly and it consistently returns worse results than Google	Set it to my default a while ago to check it out  Have to frequently go back to Google to get the answers I need	Its useless to compete with google  And I dont want to search microsofts filtered web	love the interface and enhanced technology	good pictures  bad results	Video  price  and image search a good  but Google still gives the best results when looking for regular websites	How different IS it from Live Search? Answer: NOT ENOUGH	The photographs with info blurbs are amazingly compelling  and the search works well enough for me	The accuracy of its results give Google a bit of a run for its money	Finally  a credible challenge to Google	Very good one :) Comparable to Google  Better than Google in some areas	I dont find much difference from live search and i do not like the interface	I really dont see the point of the name Bing! So far I really dont see anything that would make me shift from Google  Sorry Bill!	Its cool  But need to get better	The maps is better than Google and the search results are quick and exactly what you are looking for	Love the home page  especially	Doesnt do anything apart from being a site with a search bar and a pretty picture  Ive seen many free domains with more info than that	My default search engine  Love the daily pictures too	Why bother switching to a new search engine?	i like all the tools that it provides  but i still think google is more accurate	Its ok but you dont have an icon for ok  :)  Dont see a compelling reason to switch from Google	Currently less skewed by SEO companies  fewer bad  irrelevant returns than Google	A little crowded and not as clean as Google  but results are equal w/ G & well organized!	Much better than live com  worth trying	Please dont even get me started on how much Bing needs to diminish from all of cyberspace   Google  > FTW	Been dying for something to come and better Google and Bing seems to have done it  Fantastic interface with results on par  Love it!	I like the decision engine idea  and I like to see some competition in the search field	Its a really promising product  it has potential  Competition is always good for the end user	The results are better than Google in English  but I still prefer Google in French  As I search more in English than in French  I switched to Bing  though	Google quality for search results  better interface for some type of search  Lacking on internationalization	very nice search engine  Im very impressed Ive never tought I will let down google	yahoo made the biggest mistake of all times	Wouldnt change from Google  but it was a good search engine	I love Bing   It almost always returns results on par with Google  and the image / video search is superior   The homepage image is almost always beautiful!	Refreshingly good  Doubt it will ever replace Google  but boy do I want it to!	A simple renaming of Windows Live Search to something much less likable	Its a good thing bing is there now  atleast folks at google wont slack off  Good for the consumer	How many new search engine names is that now  Microsoft?	I want to make love to it	Bing isnt bad   it excels in its handling of video	starts off with great pictures on home page  honestly there isnt enough difference from google search as ive seen for me to make a switch yet google vs bing com	OK so its like Google  Not a reason to hate it necessarily	Ive given it a fair chance and google was always better	Very solid  but can it really beat Google?	Fuck off microsoft you innovation stifling money grabbing scrooges  Dont you have better things to do? Like fix bugs in your terrible software (windows etc)	I dont love it yet but its a nice interface   Ill try it out   I only use Google because its the best  if this is better Ill use it	So how many attempted search engines does this make it? Just give up Microsoft  Besides  to bing something just sounds innappropriate	    made in redmond   sorry  no chance	the image search is better than google	I like it  Period  just like it	Changing their name didnt nearly make them as good as Google will always be	not google (or even yahoo) but prettier than before	Smells too much like Micro$ucks	One thing  PLEASE MAKE YOUR LOGO BETTER!!!!  I love the pic of the day   And microsoft doesnt $uck  Theyre richer than u would be if you lived a million years	Have been using it daily from the day of launch  Love it!	i thing is a really good tool	totally sick of hearing about bing giving google a run for its money   my search instinct remains google not bing	google beats all  bing is NOTHING special	Another disgusting Microsoft product  Microsoft cant take the monopoly in another area  Boycott this!	Google made search vanish into the background  If youre a masochist  Bing can make it painful all over again	its visual is quite interesting    :)	Just did 250 searches (over 11 days) with Bing and Google  Bing got what I was looking for in the first five 221 times  Google 203	another useless thing microsoft created in order to try to win (or should i say bribe?) users to come back to microsoft products	Bing is an intelligent and accurate search engine capable of providing more precise results than its leading competitors  Microsoft scored big on this one	Bing is from Microsoft /end	Unnecessary and redundant   Google gets the job done  so why change?	Attempting to give it benefit of the doubt  but seems like it is losing  Google FTW	Taking my love of Google out of the equation  Bing is a great search engine   Definitely going to put a dent in Google	I dont want Google to decide for me! If you need the search engine to decide for you then what do you think you are searching?	It doesnt take days to get listed in bing unlike google	Rarely have to go beyond the first result in Google  Have to do it regularly with Bing	Google is the BEST  bing is just a try from microsoft to get back some attention after theyve LOST all the attention due their BAD windows versions!!!	Love Bing  love love love  Beats Google any day	many options and services  great start webpages and  most importantly  better results than google most of time	never like Microzeft! zeft is the shit in Arabic	its an awesome platform! http://www freethings4u co cc/	Really like Bing  Googles UI is from the dark ages of dial up  Bing is better	Loved the UI The images in the background looks good	Great search engine and feedback   much better looking than its competitors	facial mask green clay smectite   :exelent product wwwterrageena com	Pointless piece of crap	Tried it  UI is too cluttered for my taste	Map is more than 3 years out of date  Our street isnt on it  Googles is out of date  too  but at least it has the street!	Interface is very good  Better than Google  Search results are good  But still can be improved  Even i like the changing backgrounds  Map quality is good	Excellent UI  Needs to improve the results	no different than other search engines	The only thing that maters with a search engine is the quality if the results it returns period  This may look pretty but whats the point if you cant find stuf	The shopping search and cashback feature are great	Better than Google! Love the way Images are displayed and Birds Eye view on Bing Maps is great! :D	Tried it  The big features of the site Google already has or is useless to me  Several feature also require IE which doesnt exist in Linux	This was the first time Ive tried it  and I like it  It displays the content of the website much better than Google does	Search results as good or better than Google  and a much more attractive interface!	UI is too busy and it isnt as good for more technical stuff as Google  Googles pretty much tailored to my needs at the moment and keeps getting better	WAY too busy  i like googles clean ui	Really cool interface and cool silverlight intergration for visual search	Even though I prefer Google  Bing still has some good ideas that make it okay	Lumayan  aku suka	the first real rival to google that weve seen	Rent me for the superboule 786 487=2225  4 bed 2 bath	Not better or different enough than Google to care about  Insignificant in almost every way	I have used both and i like Bing a lot  It will not replace google for me soon however i thought why change from yahoo to google and i did  so who knows	+ very good image search   not real competition for Google	They skew search results to decide what they want you to see	Awesome search engine	A huge competition to Google   Only a matter of time before it gains large market share   Deffinetly the next generation of search!	very great engine and many times more useful than Googles cluster of a joke	Maybe Im just too used to Google search  but I really dont find this search engine very accurate to the things I am looking for	Its awesome! Love its images and video search!	I continue dislikeing live search  Oh dear! It has a different name! The biggest investment in search    Gods sake	its awesome   i love it     i dont like google any more    and it sucks !   bing rocks	With Bing I dont find the things Im looking for	Bing looks nice but needs better results	its microsoft so i dislike it on principle	Why using Bing when there is Google?  Couldnt find advantages over Google SE  except maybe images search results interface	Wow Bing    Where did you learn relevancy?	The only thing thats different is the looks  and I dont like them at all  The boxes they put on the picture on the home page are enough to make me hate it	I like how they put a new picture on their homepage every day	Good ideas like working together with wolfram alpha  But Google has just more know how	it isnt @Google but hey its trying	MS makes some solid  very useful apps like Windows and Office  and has made innovations in spite of what some people say  Apple = the new evil giant :P	cool image search!!	Looks pretty  pretty much same search results as google although its not on any platforms stock

Its okay but doesnt really offer a lot  You might as well use a standalone app like Tweetie or Twhirl	its great except it kinda takes a minute to get up to date w/ all the tweets	Twitterfox is a must have for todays Twitter Addicts that find themselves constantly inside their web browser	A must have addon for Firefox for anyone and everyone who uses twitter	Simply and super useful	Easy to use  quick  doesnt require much space but catches my attention everytime without beeing a nuisance  Simply cool!

Skitch is great  It only sucks that the UI prevents me from saving an image that is higher than my screen  (The sharing tab is not available then )		
494047	I love to be in the Foursquare family	I havent used the app much but I like the idea	I travel so much  its great to find new places	To many lies on Foursquare (just spoke to a friend in NY who claimed to sit in a hotel in Dubai	Love it great app  great way to discover new places near by and good way to keep track of the friends I want to follow	finally just got the blackberry app and so far so good   its a lot of fun!	this has potential  tho rite now primarily used by urbanite hipsters  im afraid itll lead 2 constant coupon feeds to your mobile whenever u walk near a biz	WinMoSquare (currently in beta) really makes foursquare attractive to Windows Mobile users	Love it!

(if you build it  they will come) =D	For me its not better than digg and i dont like the interface	Good for finding news  Has better specific sections than Digg and seems to get the news faster	i dont like the design   the content is content	Consider it the internets collective stream of consciousness  Great for procrastination  Youll be entertained  might learn something  might just smile  I like	i love this design its comfortable :D	Me encanta Reddit  lo encuentro muy superior a otros servicios similares como Digg  porque es mucho mas configurable
