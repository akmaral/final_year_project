1	More useful than I thought it would be  Its not digital crack for me like it is for others  but its certainly changed interactions with my social circle	Great extension  Im really  really digging the multiple rows of tabs  since I tend to have something like 30 open at any given time	Convenience is king  Ive bought more games through Steam than Ive ever bought in a store  and the weekly sales are a huge plus	Really great combination of several products  Has some stability and performance problems preventing love it from me  but those will hopefully get worked out	1st Jabber client I used  and good enough at what it does  but I dont have a use for it over other multi protocol IM clients  Good app  but not for me anymore	Great little plugin  The external player management is what I first used it for  but providing a inline flash player for any in page MP3s makes it a winner	Hard to beat  IEs a relic of a bygone age by now  but Opera  Safari  and Chrome dont match its customizability via plugins  Im a definite fan	Great featureset  but feels relatively unpolished and eats up a ton of RAM  I still use it for the time being  but Im shopping for a replacement	Im a big fan  Didnt see what the fuss was about  but once I started using it I was hooked  Love being immersed in the daily buzz	Absolutely wonderful  Great content  high res videos  and ads that are short enough to be worth sitting through	Ive settled on it as my preferred Twitter client  Works great; my biggest gripe is that its built on AIR  and tends to be resource heavy  Great featureset tho	High octane geek oriented social news filtering  No nonsense UI  great amounts of content  and more customizable than competing offerings  Love it	Interesting idea  A definite good first offering  though I think itll need to mature a bit before it can be a serious contender	Ill ashamedly admit to never really using finance software before Mint  but Mint made it easy and useful enough that I have no excuse not to	Mostly useless  but when its useful  its really useful  Collaborative design seems to be its niche	This + my XBox 360 completely satisfies my TV entertainment needs  Dont have cable anymore  and dont miss it	A bit of a memory hog at times  but its good enough that I use it as my primary  Does just about everything I want in an email client  and not much else	Not bad  but AIR apps have a tendency to jack up my system  Its a solid app  but Ive dropped it in favor of Digsby  since Im already using it for IM		
10667	This is one of the best think on the online solution	much more people use this searchbox

A very useful FF plug in for the tweeting inclined	Simple and effective  And the provider of vlips (video blips)  too!

35940	The best social website !	The best just after Firefox !		
5	Never use any other email app  This one surpasses them all  especially in user friendliness	So freaking cool! Download a copy and go explore your planet  Be sure to check out the topography  too  Mount Everest is really hard to find  though	Heck Yeah  I love how the interface gets better every time I log on	Anyone who is still using Internet Explorer needs to be educated	The best  most recently accurate source of information on the planet  It should totally be a legitimate source on scholarly research =P	Good to find out about movies you like  but not a very user friendly interface  Id like it more if the layout was more shiney

92548	Really great idea to rate the web ;) But reviews without any comment should be allow  But only allowed  the commend function shouldnt be abandonned in any case	free service with much functionality  Missing features like importing mails from your computer (e g  Outlook)	Just the standard for designing  Best program to do so	Nice alternative browser	Best social service!	Free  Powerful command line (bash)  You can edit it like you want ;)	free  many features  Go on like this!	Good  But needs to much effort	Best client for tweeting  facebooking and get all infos from these services  But they have still to do many things	Really great features  I like the developer functions  But too unstable  Thats why I moved to Google Chrome	Nothing to say  Dont know how to improve  Fast	Most things work  But other browser have better functionality	Best FTP client I could find	Best Linux OS  Really like it ;)	Good ideas like working together with wolfram alpha  But Google has just more know how	Its nice to get all your actions in the web bundled  But its bought by facebook  And facebook added the features to import the messages  too	I tested every browser very deeply  But Chrome was the best one  Fast  bookmark sync with Google account  Faster access to Google services like Gmail  Youtube	Great functionality with all these plugins  But the other browser are faster

89756	Interesting folks/people are met through this media		
12411	Favorite browser   Fast  clean  flexible	Keeps me up to speed on social media sites and business activity	The spice must flow!	Easy to use  powerful interface		
5436	Its a solid operating system and proves Linux doesnt have to be complicated  If I ever get another PC  Ill be running Ubuntu on it for sure	I used Paint Shop Pro for years  but with newer versions it got slower and slower  Photoshop does the opposite  and its far more powerful to boot	Twitter is a friendly community  a useful tool  and a great way to stay in touch  But a word of warning: its very addictive  Wave goodbye to your productivity!	More space and better features than its competitors and  at the moment  the only Webmail service you can access offline  I wouldnt use anything else	Occasional inaccuracies  but its not as bad as people like to make out  Dont use it for anything too important  but its great for quickly looking things up	With the amount of downloadable music available  its amazing that its free  I cant wait for TTR2 to be released in the next couple of weeks  Awesome game	Congratulations! Your iPod touch is now an iPhone Wi Fi  Its very easy to set up your profile if you dont already have one  and audio quality seems very good	I dont have an aerial socket in my room  so I use Zattoo a lot  Streaming is generally very stable and quality is decent  New channels are added regularly	Thought Id try it now theyve finally de uglied it  seeing as Tweetsville has been all but abandoned  Great app  I love replying straight from the timeline	I was surprised to see that Alexa ranks Yahoo! above Google  Mail  Answers  and Flickr are great  but Yahoo! Search sucks compared to Google	Such a simple site  but potentially a really useful one  Its great being able to find people with similar interests  and its easy to add yourself to the list	I liked it so much I paid the Â£12 for a license without ever seeing an advert  The UI is stunning  and showing @replies and DMs as threads is a great idea	I used to use this to make all new window links open in new tabs  but its included in Firefox now  Was useful back in the day  though	The fact YouTube is the biggest online video site is its greatest strength and biggest weakness  Theres some great stuff to watch  but it gets swamped by crap	The new version should make blippr a real contender in the social networking market  Tell your friends: lets make blippr the next big thing!	I use iTunes for organising my music and videos  but if Im just playing something I use VLC  Simple but powerful app	With a Pro account  Flickr is a useful tool and a great way of sharing your pictures  Its just a shame its so badly crippled if youre not willing to pay up	Definitely a powerful tool for bloggers and Web designers alike  but be prepared for one heck of a learning curve if you want to make your own themes	Feature filled  and the only software I would dream of using for organising my music and syncing my iPod  Sadly  its rapid growth has made it slightly slow	This is a really useful app  Ive been using Shazam for years on my phone  In the UK  you can dial 2580 and Shazam will text you the tag	Its Last fm for software  Tracking works well  but recommendations need to be more intelligent (e g   I obviously dont need Hotmail if Im using Gmail)	As youd expect from Apple  iWork is simpler than Office but just as powerful  Being able to export in DOC and PDF formats makes iWork a viable replacement	I think its a shame so many people are moving to Facebook  MySpace beats the pants off it in terms of usability and customisability	Suffers from an algorithm that favours power users submissions (and funny pictures from 4chan)  but Digg is still a great way to get your daily dose of news	Mac OS X isnt as perfect as everyone likes to make out  but its the best OS Ive used so far  Now Ive gone Mac  Im not going back	Now YouTube supports HD videos and downloading  Vimeo has lost its unique selling points  Uploading is much faster and simpler  though	Google Maps is a tool  Google Earth is a toy  I like zooming around the globe  but I honestly cant find a real use for it	If youve only ever used Internet Explorer  you dont know what youre missing  Firefox makes Web browsing easier  more secure  and ultimately more enjoyable	I used to use uTorrent  but then I found Transmission which is a cleaner  simpler  more customisable alternative  Also regularly updated  so its very reliable	Lemmings meets Dizzy Bee  This is an absolute joy to play  and you can either sink hours into it or play for a little while at a time		
5437	My 2nd choice  :) However  great help when comes to maintain ratios when download through private tracker	The best one stop center for latest news compared to other social networks	Address bar=Search bar is really an awesome idea Love the tabs Huge space browser for Light and speed	The best music streaming service  Fast  slick & less cluttered design  Very user friendly  Wide variety of collections	Quite better than Vista  Somehow user friendly compared to Vista  The UI also changed more to classy and elegance look  Love the bootscreen & welcome screen		
55503	Chrome user since day 1 and I love it

12424	A great Adobe AIR application for all those twitter wh*res out there!		
64472	its good and runs faster than all the other browsers but IE8 wins on its user friendly interface  Plus the new Msn toolbar seals the deal with windows live		
5460	quick and easy  if you dont follow may people :)	Well built and extensible  Big improvement from version 2	Thanks people for inventing Flickr  I can now show my pictures to the world	well done  Also a good backend to build apps on top of it	Great way to organize your digital life	essential  just (and exactly) what you need	Bestest solution ever to synch folders on different machines	A bit cpu hungry at the moment  Will improve		
5461	It was the RSS feeds of my Blips that drew me here and I grew to love the simplicity and improvements   I would love to see product reviews (i e  electronics)	The price is steep  but it must be worth it; with so many commercial and free alternatives  and after Ive switched to Linux  I still use it in a Windows VM	It has become a little bloated over the years  but as a developer and power user  nothing beats it (once you tweak it with add ons) DEATH TO MSIE!!!

8545	Mashable is THE BEST social networking website	Really great and useful  You should check this out	Yes! Just yes	Defiantly the BEST blogging platform  EVER	Flickr is a great way to share photos online  Probably the best that Ive seen yet	I love GreaseMonkey! Very useful!	I like it but I like TweetDeck more	Its fun  Im not sure how its very useful  But its fun	Best RSS reader!	I simple and good idea kepted simple (which supriseingly dosent happen often)  I really like TinyChat!	I use TweetDeck as my main twitter client  But  the only problem is that it uses a lot of API requests (Which is pretty much refreshing Twitter)	Not my kind of thing but its good	2nd best Twitter app  Tweetie is first  TweetStack is 3rd	I was a little late to start useing this but once I did I couldnt stop!	I use Mobile Me to keep everything connected  But I see why people like gmail	Its has an iPhone  online  Windows  and Mac client  It keeps you organized everywhere	Twitpic is a really easy to use  And its Twitters most popular client  I love it	I really love it  Just try it out	Hulu is a very good website for streaming TV shows! But there are two problems: The commercials and the buffering (Which Probably cant be fixed)	Theres better  But RTM is good	An OK browser but Firefox and Chrome are better	For some reason I dont like it very much  I prefer Twitter and Friendfeed  I know a lot of people that love it so Ill keep it at a I like it	I dont like the community at all  The only reason that this is staying at a like is because some people make good videos (*some* people)	Its good but Im getting a Mac soon	Really awesome  Its as good as BlogTV	I just found it and its really cool  You take a picture on your phone and email it to Posterous and its uploaded to your website	Very easy and useful  I love how simple it is to find people	Works well but theres not many times that I need to use it	Its hard to beat Twitpic  but TweetPhoto is coming close	Its Great  Twitter Search is coming close though	I really love Friendfeed  Its growing on me	I loved it since it was just a simple jailbroken app  Ive watched my baby grow up	Best bookmarking site  You can access your bookmarks anywhere  I use it every day and have over 70 bookmarks!	A must add to your RSS reader	Amazing  The future of music!	Really useful  And fun too!	Twitter is THE BEST SOCIAL NETWORK on the internet! Follow me on Twitter @ChrisWMartin	I had it ever since it was a jailbroken app  Its great but the only downside is the music	I use it every day! (Pingle is a great iPhone Ping fm client)	GREAT! Perfect for Twitter users because you write reviews in 160 letters or less  (just like how Twitter uses 140 or less)	Ive used Chrome  Its pretty cool but (In my opinion) Its not the best browser out there	Its ok  but for my current background Im using the old school Photoshop method

35028	Good: theres nothing comparable in power or usability  Bad: the UI is so bad theres a whole website dedicated to Adobe UI Gripes <adobegripes tumblr com>	Best interface for Flash video  but the T&C scare me slightly	A very different workflow to Windows and Ubuntu  but everything is so much simpler and theres no messing around in the system if you dont want to  Also  BSD	Indispensable  although the UI feels a little clunky for some reason	Beautiful  speedy and very simple  Still has quite a few UI annoyances though	I cant wait  Apart from anything else  kill the subject line! This really is the future of email	Who knew 140 characters could be such an important addition to my life? You just cant understand it until you use it	Pure Mac simplicity  A bit crap on Windows  but on OS X theres nothing better	IMAP  great UI  fast  conversations		
35026	Looking forward to Snow Leopard :)	Clean and elegant  my browser of choice	It gets the job done  I cant wait until we do most of what Flash does nativly in the browser	This is going to be friggin awesome!	Great for web development because of the powerful plugins

D:	Using this on both OS   Great ap that always notifys you if something interesting happening in the network	The most competent browser  sure its slow  but compare it with IE8 and this is MUCH more stable   Also recommended on the Mac		
85310	Me encanta Brizzly  un cliente para twitter desde la Web que me deja disfrutar de todo en un mismo sitio	He probado varias plataformas de Blogging  pero ninguna me convence  Por su facilidad y por su configurabilidad  me sigo quedando con Blogger		
11049	Can imagine life without it anymore		
37679	I dont expect to have to pay someday for all my great Google tools  They are not Microsoft  They are funded by their carefully placed ads  Good for G and me		
36348	Seesmic  seems more stable than Tweetdeck  Let me clarify   more stable on my linuxbox	Love Ubuntu  I have used Ubuntu since 5 04  It is very easy to perform administrative tasks on  The beauty of Ubuntu though is its community	Looking forward to using this app  on my G1  I just signed up for an invitation today	Just started my blog here a few days ago  I like the interface and the whole user experience		
11048	This is great  Ill look for you on Twitter  Jennifer!		
82283	Somehow I lost the music in my 30s and now its back with a vengeance  Spotify is superb!

35006	Great service to discover new websites  One big downside: You can not share your favorites easily		
86635	I truly tried to use Wave  but the problem is that I  just like many others  do not really get the idea behind it   GOOGLE  needs to further develop it

12350	while I was an early adopter of myspace  I found that from a usability POV Facebook was better  From a customisation stance  I still prefer Myspace		
72012	Whatever they did with Wordpress  the did it right  Other Blog services should mimic this platform as much as possible	Google wave allows for instant viewing and use of items not available in IM (documents  charts etc )  The concept is awesome  and its not there yet  but soon

87983	Best paid twitter app there is! Nice UI and there are no faults for me	Nothing to say except Google it! Best thing on the web!	A simple web design editing software  Not only that you can use it to quickly edit and crop images  Fast start up and very easy to use	An awesome site to check out videos  Also useful for education sometimes  Failblog channel is my personal favourite	A brilliant way to listen to music  It is free  quality is brilliant and all the songs you need are on there	The best idea since Google! Love the ease of it and good to update your status and let your friends know	It is now my default broswer  As many other Google products it is simple and easy to use  The bookmark sync feature is awesome	Very easy to blog  Simple and is fast  All you do is use your email and post	Best social networking site out there! Also best time waster online! Good to talk to friends and share photos	This is one of my main sources of social media news  It is updated very often and is very resourceful	Brilliant online storage  Easy to use and best of it is free  2GB is more than enough for storing documents online	Like many other Google products! I simply love this! I have all my feeds on here and can simple log in to my Google account and check it all at one place	The best mail service out there  It is very fast and secure  Simple to use and is hassle free  Only problem is there is a lot of spam but it does get caught	A nice simple URL shortner with analytics		
1948	It is really hard to find anything decent on it  the lack of real programming also hurts it  Can still be fun  but just difficult to find it	It is a really easy app for blogging  The plug ins allow for more powerful tools  though they often go neglected	I think Google has started to lose traction as a search in the last couple of years  but it is still consistently good	I dont use it much for storing photos  but for finding good photos  it is a gem  However  the search isnt great	tons of space  great clean interface  I prefer this over software mail now!	It is good for what is there  but choice for TV is limited  even if they have a show they only show 3 or 4 at a time	I love it  thinking of getting a text plan just so I can twit on the go	It is still a good resource but the interface seems to get worse with time	Easily the best overall browser  no longer king of speed  but the extensions are still what make the difference over Chrome	It is very fun to play with  and very cool for a map program as well  I like finding new places with it	Not a bad blog for the socialsphere of the internet		
85321	I mainly use it for the stats  and I fucking love stats  Stats  man! Its also pretty great to find and keep track of events	Clean UI and great extensability  Publishing and organising is a lot of fun  Pro account is cheap and worth it  Free account is very limited

12368	This is basically the only email I actually like to use  All other webmail should be this easy and intuitive	Steeped in self importance (like all social sites really)  but is good because its short (like this site)  so it works with my ADD

8595	Seamless integration between Amazon S3 and OS  Automatic backup is really useful  Would love it if it could edit ACL		
61384	i love some one    i need he for life		
74699	An excellent Twitter App only let down by the fact it runs on the AiR platform which is terrible	The only torrent client anyone should use on windows  I used to even use on linux through wine  its that good	Simple fast with stunning uptime  gmail is the definition of a system that just works	Almost overnight became an absolutely essential communication and news tool  hope they find a revenue model soon	Simple and blindingly fast that takes full advantage of the hardware I give it  Exactly what an OS should be	Without google you would have to find your way around the web with the likes of Yahoo & MSN  I wouldnt bother going online if that was the case	Firefox enables the web  exactly how you want it  An extension for almost anything  I just wish they would work on making XULRunner a bit less of a memory hog	It was a superb idea while it lasted but since the CBS buyout development has ground to a halt and I dont see the service being around much longer	Simply the definition of speed when browsing the web  still needs some work on the extension API like it needs the ability to stop elements from loading at all	Fast became an essential way to keep in touch with my friends  plus play some fun games  But I trust Zuckerberg about as far as I could throw this planet		
97335	too nice   its even getting addictive		
74694	Lots of potential  and lots of work to go before this is something Ill love  I look forward to the day I can love it	Fast becoming my favorite browser  though Google has A LOT of work to do on this incomplete and buggy prototype	I love the social take on music; I enjoy sharing my track history and listening to tunes in my Library	The best email app ever; nothing else stands up  Period	The most important and essential tool in any graphic designers toolbox  and the cornerstone of my own design endeavors	THE source of info on the net  period  Some may question its accuracy since anyone can edit  but they arent clear on the sites edit policies and QA protocol	By far the BEST browser out there today  though Chrome is fast encroaching  Ive found Firefox to become somewhat bloated and slow due to addon instability	Gotta love the connectivity potential		
59068	tell people twitter and they listen even MPs Its Awesome!!		
53763	Great wish I could get on my iPhone  damn apple I have loved them for years but now they have grown more into pop culture they now have a big ego for problem		
37632	Never used the previous versions  but 3 0 does more than I ever though a phone could do  With th right apps  the features like the compass become essential	After over a month Im still using the free version of Twitterfon  Its quick and stable  does everything I need  and the ads arent intrusive  Why pay more?		
11003	The best OS right now in the world	The only issue is they write too many articles a day  which it makes a RSS no so attractive		
77736	it just works! they do have awful user agreements if you happen to have read them  but who doesnt?! let us hope they will never be abused		
38965	First twitter!  Not sure its worthwhile!!!!

Low system resource use  and updates automagically! :D	Very very handy   love the feature where you double click the desktop to hide all your icons  :)	I dont see why everyone hates Vista so much  Ive been using it for ages  and its almost identical to XP  but with a few tweaks  Roll on Windows 7 though  ;)	This is definitely a good twitter app  though there are a few bugs here & there with the 12 seconds recording etc   Highly recommended all in all	Like the more social aspect of the site  but people stopped interacting so I left for twitter	The resource for anything movie orientated  Every movie ever made listed    Just awesome	Like it   definitely has room to grow  and needs to in some areas  Potential to rival Twitter  but not yet	Great site for web 2 0 media  news  reviews  beta information and much more	Great site to aggregate your web life    connect it to Facebook for the ultimate sharing combo	By far the best iPhone twitter client  and to top it all off  its free!	Great app! A good way to discover new music  and a great way to make a large itunes esque music library with no downloads  Seamless streaming too!	Ive used firefox for years  but have recently started using Chrome	I wanted to choose dislike    but almost everyone I know is on there  and I cant change that  So Ive learned to like it  lol	One of the best wordpress comment plugins out there    Tops disqus in my opinion	Just got a new HTC Hero with Android  and its awesome  Its like a jailbroken iPhone with widget support  :)	If youre on the net  and not on Twitter  youre obviously not a geek! lol	Its a great idea  but not enough people seem to use it  :/	I love Virb  but I cant get anyone to abandon Facebook for it :/	The best online bookmarking site around	This is a great site  and the ability to scrobble your posts just makes it better!  :)

94387	So far so good  Were testing this out with Clutch  I believe you get 2GB free storage space for signing up		
74770	twitter is only OK in my eyes  Its the API that makes it better than it is	Top dog for social media happenings  Often falls into the quantity over quality side of posting though	My new fav toy! Will be making good use of it throughout 2010	Love ping fm  One of the best aggregation tools out there	I prefer Posterous (the email function wins it) but Tumblr comes a close second	cant live without it   seriously  cant do my job without it!	YouTube is by far my fave site  How did I ever live without it??	The ultimate resource site   take note		
27507	i use twitter mostly for professional networking   its a fantastic tool for global communications

8683	I absolutely love Evernote! Keeps my notes and personal clippings organized	Buggy but interesting and encourages discussion   Love it		
36450	Good for keep track of listening habits and finding new artists and songs  The site design could use an improvement though	Great service but Im not quite as addicted    yet	Cant really fault Opera on anything    it has the features I need and want in a browser		
6025	Gradually improving but works needs to be done  Make it so that you can blip ANYTHING   literally	addictive and ultimately somewhat pointless way of sharing life		
15531	Google Voice Rocks!  Bringing convenience  flexibility  and control to our often chaotic and overwhelming tangle of communication systems and devices		
8689	Needed to warm up to  but couldnt live w/o it now	Still finding more of the funnier amateur stuff here		
11175	I use it for more than 2 years now and its quite good  much better than other free webmails in Poland		
72123	I think there is some real potential replacing e mail  But they need backwards compatibility and a standard for others to base on		
73453	www Blip fm/mellejohnson is my station and is easy to use as Twitter and great if you have your own content to promote  Plus the founders are very open		
64504	Twitter is fantastic for building an online network and sharing items of interest  It pushes social networks beyond the exclusivity and personal nature of FB		
74781	Interestingly enough  I see people pulling there phones out to tweet and sending phone calls directly to voice mail  Times certainly have changed yet again!		
8681	Just testing out this social rating thing  Works nicely  not sure if Ill use it much		
28847	more words than twitter and just as good	Where you can catch raw talent  motivation  up and coming  already famous folks at this is the place to go		
387	Great way to manage budgets and keep track of ALL your assets and finances		
53850	Love the new integration for e mail  VoIP  chat and at the apps  This is missing in the boring facebook inbox		
44074	I love it    Except for the fact that the other people who use it see someone using windows    USE UBUNTU  ITS BETTER lol    I dont like that	Good to remember stuff    not altogether that functionable tho	An 87    SERIOUSLY!! THEE best time waster  lol site  and beyond in existence	Lightroom for Post Production all the way!!!	Again  twitter is really not my thing	GREEN BIRDY!! YOU ROCK! If only you spread your wings and allowed for email and social networking like my beloved Digsby	While good  it doesnt not compare to acrobat com and zoho	Digsby  Ya dig? Awesome    chat  mail  facebook     Incredible    If only it was as customizable as adium  which doesnt have to focus on mail and facebook	For chat only though  adium and digsby are better	Just add Addons and    WOW!! This would be I more than love it  it would be I     IDK  its completely awesome	Good for finding local restraunts!	Search  docs  Chrome  Android  Maps  earth     Awesome	Never was into feeds untill I tried this   It keeps me interested during spare time and during work  like my own personal magazine!	Garageband makes it for me  though I like Imovie as well	I like Easy Cleaner a little bit better	Expensive but has the most awesome feature set EVER!	Blippr is better  cus it has everything	One thing  PLEASE MAKE YOUR LOGO BETTER!!!!  I love the pic of the day   And microsoft doesnt $uck  Theyre richer than u would be if you lived a million years	In terms of straight up tv show watching  it beats youtube by a long shot	Blippr was a stroke of genius    Thank you Mashable!	Its good  but im not a big twitter person    not any of my friends use it	A great add on  kudos	Ready to ride the wave when it comes!	Awesome for finding stuff   Howd you find that game? Oh  I just happened to Stumbleupon it!	But im not an adult  so I dont have to worry about finances :D	YAY no switching windows!	Its good    Not enough people I know use it    Then it would be a love!	Its ok  but blogging isnt really my thing	Windows media player begone!	For twitter  it is the top  but unfortunately  as in my many other reviews  im not a big twitter person	Nice    Still think Office is better   This is about the same price	FREE TRACKS YAY!	Though just a mod of Firefox  I dont like it    just get firefox and stuff	Yep    Googles genius shines again    fast mail  themes  plugins  the firefox of email!	Its a good idea  just a bit poorly executed    If they integrated it into the facebook status or twitter  then itd be a love	Much better than all of the competitors out there	Flickr  where to start    Much more social than google images  but sometimes has less relevant results   This is better for a laugh or personal pictures	Fine for random facts	fine for blogging  but i dont blog that much	Its a great app  but again  Ill reemphasize that Im not a big twitter person	YAY!! I CAN SEE MY HOUSE FROM HERE!	This is awesome    spotlight but 1000000% better	I think that xmarks has better built in functionality	Except for the fact im not really a weight watcher	Yep  smooth  awesome    what else do you want haters? (Plus Im a dedicated Windows User :D)	Did someone just say     FIREFOX? =D	Doesnt read M4A well yet  but when it does    Amazing	Its good  not as good as windows 7  not even close	YAY!!! USERSCRIPTS GALORE!	Better than Iphone  not as good as windows mobile  (Im talking in terms of customizability without hacks)	Wikipedia  you look up something simple  get diverted by a link in it     hours later you ask yourself  What was I looking up again? I LOVE YOU WIKIPEDIA!	Loved it  that is til mom made me delete it	LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!! (except for lack of UI customizability  and other hacks [which i LOVE to do] So for me  WM and Android are better  cus of XDA DEVELOPERS!!!!)	YAY! do essays in the car with iphone (which i dont have anymore :)		
8679	FriendFeed is the greatest thing on Earth!		
11178	Twitter completes me :)		
36459	Good one   but soon its gonna be Snow Leopard!		
8695	Cool site  I think it could turn into a great resource if enough people contribute	I am glad Twitter has really taken off  I find myself spending more and more time on it	I think Google Voice has a lot of potential  For a free beta  it certainly exceeded all my expectations	Still getting used to the new design but have really enjoyed reconnecting with old friends	Mashable has been a great source of info  I am glad Leo had him on TWIT		
45	Unlimited storage  no deleting  super easy searching of everything ever sent or received  plus a good chat tool and other extras  Gmail rocks my socks	Does anyone even use that Other Browser anymore? I love the plugins  switching between tabs by keyboard shortcut  and I love that it saves my tabs when I exit!	Its fun  super easy to use  and a little bit addicting  sort of like how Facebook is a little bit addicting	Kinda sad  I hardly even scan the actual news for headlines anymore since my friends status updates keep me in the loop  Its a great way to stay connected		
61481	To be in touch with friends all over the world!	Cant live without it! (very geek lol)		
8694	the easiest way to broadcast my thoughts that are too short for a blog post	Is definitely a Twitter client that Ive been waiting for  but agree that its not for the casual Twitter users  See my detailed review http://tr im/td4iphone	Its as Apple had described but more  Although the missing features found only in iPhone 3G S has convinced me to upgrade http://tr im/oDB5	Indispensable tool to keep me up to date on what my friends are up to  especially those overseas	One of the easiest free blog engine/CMS (Content Management System) to use  Of course thats only second to SquareSpace

89817	Twitter is terrific for keeping your finger on the pulse of your social network and keeping connections alive with small investments	Works fast and well  Recommended items (under Explore) are awesome for discovery	Better than Twitter  and integrates seamlessly with it  (I update Twitter from Identica ) Plus  its open source

51215	Its great for social networking with friends who live far away  but I havent started using it for work  Sometimes I find it a distraction from my business!		
11159	I know it is an extension for Firefox instead of its own app but it really adds to my productivity		
67	Havent had any reliability issues  though it can be a bit slow  I wish there was a way to make the HTML version your default	Great way to find out a lot of useful information  Not a great resource for real research  but that was never its intention	Good UI  and a decent way to store and share all of your bookmarks	Great search engine  but some of the new features are more annoying than useful  Automatically inserting similar words messes up a lot of my searches	Great lightweight audio player  Extremely customizable  with good extension support  Native support for all major audio formats  except RealAudio	Best browser for my needs  The extensions are great  and the customizability is unmatched  Fairly secure  though it can be a bit of a resource hog after a while	Best torrent application Ive used on Windows  Very lightweight  but also extremely customizable	Great user interface  and incredibly useful tool for Firefox  Imported user commands are currently a bit of a security risk  at the moment	A great source of information about a lot of movies  However  it tends to be slow  and the recommendations could use more work  Could use a better interface	Great way to discover new music  Especially great when used with last FM  with the mashup pandoraFM	It took me a while to figure out the point of Twitter  but its great once you find interesting people to follow and interact with	Takes a while before it can give you accurate recommendations  but you can discover cool new music  and learn about your listening habits by sticking with it	A bit of a resource hog  but extremely useful for reading twitter feeds  It sometimes has memory leaks and has to be restarted to make it work properly

73482	better than my other torrent clients	Trying   kinda like the themes		
24438	Awesome stuff   looking forward for it		
89839	I used to love FF  but it has become very bloated and slow over time  But still do use it from time to time	The best browser around  Lightning fast and reliable  Cant wait to see it take FF and IE market share	This is one of the easiest apps I use   Everyone I show it to are impressed and get Dropbox account themselves	First I didnt understand it  Now  it is an essential communication tool I use on regular basis		
52554	Needs a lot of bug fixing  man!

74730	Great desktop  mobile or web access to your files   This has been a huge winner for me	I like Shelfari  have been a user for over a year and love the improvements they have made over time   An iPhone app would easily make this review a Love It		
95673	Great online video browser with social aspect  Videos from various sources  gives good recommendations and an addictive user interface  Share videos on Facebook		
40521	The most versatile blog and website platform out on the web today   You can just about set up any kind of site you want		
40528	I tried other desktop clients but tweetdecks help & streams made tweeting much more enjoyable		
9164	very good as an IMAP client  coloured tags are cool	Good  clean interface  now mostly free of bugs   I have used it for years		
35172	It has brilliant security  Ive only gotten things called Trojans  but I dont think those are viruses  so theyre probably helping my system  :) IE ftw		
9163	Its fast and my default browser  but I use it with Firefox    there are some extensions I really like there   Also Chrome seriously needs bookmark all tabs		
3858	use it quite alot with my graphic designer		
23183	This is the fastest browser out in my opinion   Havent had any problems with it   Extension/addon support and it may just win my whole heart	Runs perfect on my Hp Mini 1000   Infact its faster than any linux distro  or other windows OS Ive tried on it   Indeed much more stable than Vista   Perfect		
28873	I just love it  its very handful and you dont even have to bother yourself about anything  it is just what it is! S	Its amazed how much information it has! xD

53802	Looks great  so far		
15571	Ive been using Seesmic for a few weeks now and I like it  but I dont love it yet		
15570	The best Blogging software available		
93004	I was skeptical at first  Ive never looked back since  Controling  enriching and sharing my web knowledge has never been so easy and fun  Thank you  Diigo!		
9177	NutshellMail helps me keep track of all my Facebook  Twitter and other email accounts activity by sending me consolidated email alerts on a schedule I choose		
9178	Simply the best  All you could want in a web browser  and its on every conceivable OS		
93002	Still works like a charm  since ever  First email I ever made  and Ive never needed any other		
41840	I downloaded it just so I could be different than the Get Fx buttons	My RL friends use AIM  my online friends use MSN  Nice  but chats arent postable on bash org		
36495	Everything missing to iphone is know available		
9175	I love it its a 100 tomes better then internet explorer which will probably be obsolete very soon		
60108	I love how you can login to other sites with this singal account! Im using the login with Twitter on Blippr now!	Hi5 has new improvements that make it awesome! I like it!	A bit slow with homescreen swipes and app startups but it is truly a wonderful phone OS	The ability to set themes is great!	I use plurk everyday! You can hook it up to Twitter  Facebook  Yahoo!  and more!	All the apps are soooooo addicting! FarmVille etc    And almost everyone is on it so you can hook up and talk with your friends!		
26222	neat and clean and simple also small and free	so many addons how can u not love it   a browser as u want it to be	exactly what it says  Internet Movie Database	has a whole package  u know g life	i used to love it but now it feels to cluttered with so many new features and partnerships  like meebo and rotten tomatoes	all in one note management  i use the portable free version   it wont minimize to taskbar but the installed one does	neat   clean   free   small   portable also available   easy   also notifies about mail		
82357	I care about it to the extent I can use it to get work! not sure where its headed but right now seems significant		
14247	twitter is fun and i have found many people of like mind and also people i could possibly work with	i use it in some way every day

80761	Makes finding great articles quick and easy!		
78446	I can use the Google translator! Awesome!	Im still exploring blippr  There are various of application here		
54478	Needs work  other services like vimeo are much more superior  But youtube works	Playlisting need help    other than that nothing is wrong  There is a reason vlc is the only media player I ever use		
33531	Pandora was the original music discovery thing  and its still on a roll	Its not as good as bloglines organization wise  BUT the interface is lovely  and it has tagging!	Tumblrs really good for people who dont have time to write long articles  or want to have lots of media only posts		
10894	As a newbie  the articles & tips r so helpful & a necessity in my day to day social network planning @ work and for me  Thx so much for this Web 2 0 book offer!		
33539	fuc it im bored n ima kill skylars bitch azz n tay tay iz a fuckin weirdo on da homiez		
1218	In my opinion this is easily the best BitTorrent client currently available  Simple and clean  just the way I want my torrenting to be  Highly recommended	Gmail changed the way I use e mail and I would struggle to go back now  Innovations such as conversations and labeling make e mail a quick and simple process	I must admit that I was a fan of Vista once the kinks had been worked out of it but Windows 7 is a step up  Fast and easy to use with some great little touches	A simple and clean interface makes the whole experience of blipping a joy  The recommendations I have received have proven to be inspired  so go blippr!	A great place to share your photos and get tips from those you meet  It is easy to discover truly incredible images and photographers and interact with them	The more you use it the better it gets  Programs such as scrobblers help make the process of finding or being recommended new music nice and simple		
46834	but i keep having problems loggin in  i have reported this and no one has got back to me  i have reported this problem several times over the last 3 days		
42477	Im liking this!  Love the different themes too!

9197	Its too bad Sunny in Philadelphia isnt completely available anymore   But still a great site		
9195	I like Blippr    just started using it today  My first impression is that this is what the Videos Images sections of Digg com should have been	working good so far    LOL		
9196	Simple and easy way to manage money within my communities		
12605	great resources + apps; keeps me organized no matter where I am	Great resource  Im constantly visiting it to find out how to or know something new bout the mashable wrld  Thanks Pete!		
77101	How can I make all my friends come on Facebook ?

79763	Like the My World tab  but could be faster as a browser		
79766	love is very important but with careful  also like to be loved		
53158	Great if not greatest micro blogging media hub  Always the latest trending & of debate  10 out of 10 from me	A must have for those of us that enjoy and want to easily share content to our favorite social media hubs  a 10/10 from me	Its becoming more and more of a source of quick up to the minute information hub  It really is a social network hub  but is also more	Just recently started using Opera  and have become a big fan  Anything with open development is always a good thing  in my opinion  Web 5 0 is their hi point	Love it  Love it Love it  But only with latest stable release  Feature rich  supports 1000s of plug ins & best of all  its not IE  #Opensource	I somewhat like Pandora radio  but I was referred here from Avatar Pandora  lol		
87389	Im still committed to it  Theres lots of potential left  Maybe marry it to Buzz?		
3888	Great to have an online version of Word  be it a basic alternative	I wish this was far more popular than it is   I prefer this over Twitter but everyone uses Twitter  simple as that   The responded tab is cool	Nice and simple but its Digsby for me for its integration of all the services I use   If those services in Gtalk then Id swap  : )	Potentially a very useful and interesting service   Looking forward to the upcoming WP plugin which Ill definitely add to my site	I rarely use it now  too busy on FriendFeed and Twitter but its an OK service   I can catch up with my real life friends with FB	This seems to be the best of the bunch  but ZumoDrive might be a contender	Looks a good alternative to WMP and iTunes	I only speak for the music site: I like a lot   I check the featured artists each week and regular search for music or new artists	One of the best sites on the Internet   Great community  superb features that are being added to and updated all the time and very addictive   Love it!!	Perhaps not liked as much as previous  I still use it to find cool stuff and the recommendation engine seems to work for me	Lots of fun and interesting to see the rest of the World   Very  very useful	Even though theyve started removing music videos from the UK on YT its still the video site I go to first	Best news reader around	Good site  but discarded it as I use too many such services   If there was a way to submit to it when I bookmark/like on other services then great  but alas	Not really used but I can see this being very useful	I need to try this more but it seems pretty useful	My weblog service of choice   I love the latest version  the plugins available and how easy and customisable it is	Not perfect but its support for so many services wins it for me	Pretty cool but I couldnt get into it   Im keeping an eye on it though  : )	Lots of information here  perhaps could do with a lick of paint here and there  : )	Pretty good user friendly version of Photoshop	Excellent site  a regular read for me	Potentially very useful   A good service already could be great once this new all in one comments service (seen on Mashable) is released	The best browser on the net atm  It still needs proper script support & addons might be an interesting addition but it cant be beaten for speed and simplicity	Im undecided on the best social media site for us book fans but this is certainly in the top 3	I dont really use its unique features but might do once it swaps to Google Chrome from Firefox	Love it  yeah there might be the odd mistake here and there but its the reference site of choice for me   The design is great!	I used to use this all the time but its one of the services Ive discarded like Delicious  still very good though	Well they have lots of cool stuff  the search site  the browser  etc	Good site  well theyve bought this site so gotta say I like them  ; )	Its got its critics but I like it  Most stable version of Windows Ive personally used   Just wished it was faster   Windows 7 looks nice though	OK but Disqus is the king at the moment	Excellent new service from Kosmix  personalising your newspaper is dead simple and it looks very neat too   Very customisable	A must have for Firefox users  though I use Chrome now  ; )	Good  just wished scripts worked properly (or at all in the alpha/2 0 version) in Google Chrome	Nice app/service but not used it much	Well ya kinda need it nowadays  ; )	Excellent  the premium photo editing app   But Adobe need to drop the ridiculous price tag on the new version though  no way am I upgrading! : (	Its good but  for me  its memory hungry and very slow!  I use it mainly for the sidekicks  Last fm and iLike sidebars	Pretty useful Twitter directory	A must have for any Windows user   I wished updating it was easier though	Easily the best photo sharing site out there   Love its community type features   I upload mainly to here		
86084	finally just got the blackberry app and so far so good   its a lot of fun!		
69503	hmmmm   so far so gud		
66477	Your opinion of this app in 160 characters ohttp://www blippr com/home/edit/servicesr less		
2571	I just wish more of my friends used it!	Ties together all your social networking needs into one  Firefox based browser  Still has teething problems but once you use it you wont want anything else		
74099	now days i am unable to log in properly as well as attachment of certain files  This has been experienced in the recent past Any technical problems please		
53161	Sounds great!  Looking forward to a new communication venue!  Sindy		
83805	Twitter is more for functionality than social networking  in my opinion		
83811	cool  style able		
10877	It has the best design of all time  No other website even comes close to it in terms of freshness and simplicity		
79794	Twitter the Town Cryer of our generation  Love it!		
49091	Kool way to stay connected with your professional colleagues		
78468	So far  its great  That said  I havent had to do a restore  But you can map the cloud space as a drive  so direct file access shouldnt be a problem

Google has it GOING ON In the morning when I get on the net  its like Christmas when I see a new GOOGLE App		
10883	heyy! thats G R E AT :)

92784	How could you not love the power of Photoshop   awesome program!	I use this to update and review all of the my tweets   has worked well for me so far	Perfect choice for us   Firefox everytime	The best thing for international calls  As Long as you dont mind wearing a headset :)	Still getting to grips with how I can use it to its full potential to expand my business network online	Use it everyday   normally it works perfectly  but sometimes it can be having a bad day and take forever to load	Just getting the hang of using it at the moment but   it seems really good for managing all of our social media accounts in one place   plus we love the stats	Drop Box is really excellent online sharing and collaboration tool   works perfectly with our Apple Macs		
91458	Finally  intelligent two way social communication		
90127	Not quite ready for prime time  but with time it will be compelling		
46809	Good  but the ads are very repetitive	Great to find new interesting or funny photos  but you dont get much space unless you pay $25/year		
58871	Twitter Is The Opium Of The Masses		
2592	Finding it useful  but messy		
37093	Really The God Father of Streaming Videos

56213	i like to fly with my girl  but no girl friend		
70504	I think its great     but could do with more intergration from google chat     Would be nice to be able to use it in a desktop app rather than on the browser		
66491	its cool to know what everybody is doing  Your friends  family and even celebs!	Better than Google! Love the way Images are displayed and Birds Eye view on Bing Maps is great! :D

65175	i love google   they are a very unique company   they are capable of doing anything and have the resources and money to do it  they are the modern day microsoft	i like it but its a little TOO OPEN   i need a little privacy   why should all my friends see what all my other friends are saying to me		
68202	yea its good i like facebook		
70521	It works  Hate the cones though		
69535	I lurve it    as long as it can show me what i want to see from this website   heehehhe		
29473	Hard to get the full benefit on wordpress com  suspect hosting myself is the way to unleash the power within	Skype and Facebook chat worked easy peasy on my N82  whats not to like?		
31785	Just started using this  Great access to music  but navigating the site is difficult	Best browser out so far		
29479	results should be more graphical  and more organized  not just a plain listing		
77148	 Another time  i shall give to you my opinion on it  after to have taken a little moment to see it very well  Okay  bye and next time !		
10861	Awesome program  just needs identi ca and friendfeed for me to fully embrace it	Good  but not as good as it could be    especially after requiring people from other countries to pay to use their radio service	Plurk is simple and fun to use as a microblogging site  No API gives it a lower rating from me though	Facebook is ok  Too many apps out there for my taste	Friendfeed is easy to use and improving all the time	Great program to manipulate photos and other pictures	Gmail is the only email I need	Good jumping off point for information	Ubuntu is my linux system  I run it on two computers	Great time waster  Good way to discover different parts of the web	Microblogging  Thats all I have to say	Gwibber is a microblogging app that updates twitter  identica  jaiku and the like with your status updates  Runs on Linux only	Linkedin is good for business related connections

10829	Newcomer to last fm  but instantly hooked		
57562	I think blippr is cool!!!!!!!!!		
77174	They say that knowledge is power therefore sharing knowledge is a means of empowering others and increasing common understanding  which makes a better world	Very convenient way of summarising your background acting as a virtual resume		
90141	I think google buzz will be better once people on google buzz talk about more than google buzz and whether google buzz is better than twitter or facebook		
90140	I havent seen a TON of difference between this and twitter other than you can post longer sentences and your profile is more accessible to strangers		
56238	the only think that might could be better is wave :p		
29444	An easy interface for reviewing stuff  Custom tweet format would be nice		
83852	I love it  but i would love even more  if Google would buy it  so i could use my 80GB Google Storage		
50930	Its fun  App invitations get annoying though	My favorite email service		
5634	Array of colour schemes & fonts to choose on  It makes tweet updates more interesting Its worth using	Google never need to be explained why its an excellent search engine	Having own blog & domain is really possible with blogger service Just simple as a piece of cake Just sign up with e mail ID & get to your blogging world	Same UI like Tweetdeck but I still prefer Seesmic for its better management system Kinda easy	Its just like view photos on Apple Macbook Exciting & utter classy to browse images The 3D way & smooth scrolling is absolutely cool	Unlimited titles & topics to find out  Real feed for information seekers Youll never dry out information	It makes the browsing session extremely cool & exciting	Its really recommend for twitter junkies/crazies who have huge number of friends  Its looks bit professional with quite impressive features	Come on man  Its cool windows that Im using right now  since 98	Manage the desktop icons by put in one place & invisible way to clears the clutter Its pretty clean	Its really good idea but Im always scared with the over expose features which can make criminals to get information easily Seriously consider this  !!!	I dont know which platform will be the best place to share the crisp clear photos none other than Flickr itself	The environment really cool & eye appeal   Users even can upload clip in HD format Best place for creative mind	Communicate in a professional way & can get the world wide open	At least you get something to share with your friends for idle talk	It makes things much more easier with just get know your updates in a single predecessor  without have to sign up every time to open an app	Its a HUGE WORLD for videos You just name it  IT will play it	The entire file sharing is easy even newbie also could use it I get extra space every time invite my friends Lack of pain neck features is major note	Cool to share multimedia contents reviews opinions & views in a single platform	Haha  its not monkey at all but its  very helpful buddie with javascript thinggy Im using it for download Apple movie trailers easy as pie	No matter how many social networks you have it makes the thing extremely easier for your buddies to follow your updates in a single platform	Decent fast & pretty cool data transfer at a time Throw your portable devices if you dont like or hate this coolest data transfer app Youll lose easiness	Simple clean & cool Friendly UI and exactly my 2nd choice after FF

47244	Gets the job done perfectly  And I dont even need to pay for it	Ubuntu 9 04 is the best OS Ive ever used so far  Although I did hate it when 8 04 was the latest release  Never tried 8 10 though  I was using SUSE at the time	A pretty cool service  Good use of AJAX    IF I COULD USE IT  Google Maps refuses to work on Firefox 3 0 13 for Ubuntu and Google Earth wont work either	I use it for all my email accounts and RSS feeds	Definitely the best email service  It supports POP/IMAP and lets you use it for FREE (unlike Yahoo) and doesnt throw ads all over your messages	I like how easy it is to figure out  I was able to figure it out within 10 mins  Im still trying to figure out squarespace and I only get 14 days free with it	Way better than ASP	Way better than Windows  It allows me to actually FIX the problem instead of restarting and hoping the problem magically gets fixed	I follow it on Facebook  Has some pretty interesting articles  Always fun to comment on them	Im not a photographer and I dont really upload pictures but a lot of the other pictures that people upload can be pretty cool	Everything Ive seen Google come out with is done amazingly  Except for Google Pages  I didnt like the organization of that	Very useful tool for voip and video chat  Unfortunately it charges you to call landlines	I like its attempt to integrate all sorts of web tools into one app  The problem is its slow for me and the IRC part of it sucks  Ill stick to FF for now  :)	Nice and stable web browser  Also compliant  If only I could run it on Linux without an emulator	Its a very handy app  I added on the Facebook  Skype  and Twitter plugins to make it support ALL my protocols	I love Blippr because it doesnt allow people to ramble on about how much they hate or love something  Plus my attention span is short	I like how it shows information in the bottom frame about the song youre listening to  The embedded browser might have been overkill but otherwise very nice	Great for playing weird formats  It unfortunately doesnt have a library to organize my media in so I use Rhythmbox for the most part instead	Great video sharing tool	Now that theres a release for Linux I love it  Its way less of a RAM hog than Firefox (on Linux at least) All it needs is a Solaris release and and more addons

543	Simply amazing photo hosting site	My premium e mail client	The easiest bloging tool which is becoming more and more addictive	With more friends joining in its the best place on the web;)	Little fox is not so little any more		
31042	For a non programmer like me  Wordpress and its army of plugins is the bizniss	prefer Tumblr as it is faster  but Flickr is handy		
32373	No nonsense app  No bloated features  just what you need	Fantastic for finding new music  even if its far from mainstream!	Good   but lacking the equivalent of Firefoxs extensions  Till it has add on support  Im staying with Firefox	Its whatever you want it to be  Without it  blippr wouldnt exist!	Good  But a complete memory hog	Does everything it needs to and is stable  Never have to worry about running out of space

11409	Love it  No you dont only have to tweet about what your eating  Makes you a better writer  more creative & connected with the world now  All in 140chars or les	By far the best iPhone App for Twitter		
36709	Cool app  a little squashed but gets the job done	Pretty good site for small updates  Dont have a huge use for it though	My default search engine  Love the daily pictures too	Great site for getting information quickly and easily or for researching more in depth into a topic	Good for finding random news or funny pictures but not good for keeping up to date with world events or important things  Basically a time to waste time on	A good IM client but not the best  Went back to WLM straight away	Best social blog  Definitely	Brilliant  Best OS ever  Love the new task bar  It is genius	Good for finding news  Has better specific sections than Digg and seems to get the news faster	Handy little app that works brilliantly	Fast  fast  fast  Brilliant	Great browser  Normally has features before other browsers	The best public picture sharing site	Better than any other social network	Just the best video streaming site  Everything is on it	Great review site	One of the best map services online

58937	porque soy una gatita chula		
8883	Great site  lots of info & interesting sites  I have found some really neat things via Digg  But at times I wish theyd believe me that my submission is unique	Extensive and comprehensive  My favorite online library site  Definitely the best web library for all info regarding the book world	Best thing about Twitterrific is the bird sounds it makes that annoy the hell out of anyone in the room with you  Priceless amusement!	Grand  Great starting point for any kind of research  Info is usually reliable and correct    but I always re check it  Format is perfect for an encyclopedia	Works great  I find it easy to navigate and customize  I need a bigger bookmarks bar though	Good for online shelf  Appearance wise this is the best of the virtual shelves  Clear cover pics and fancy cases	Flickr is the site that I find myself spending hours on without meaning to have even signed in  Its incredible  My strongest addiction on the web	I really like iTunes  I know most hate having to pay but aside from that I love the fact that I can buy a cd at 3:15am and have it loud & clear in a minute	I like it for quickly keeping bookmarks  Good at sorting through tags and categories	Good page source  Submission process is a bit tiring  but keeps info relevant for the most part	Would the world still rotate on its axis if Google ceased to exist? Google would be there to document the event anyway  I bet  What doesnt Google do?	Of course  But Im pissed about the cost of upgrading	I cannot express in words how much I love Mashable! Its the first email I open when I get to work and it takes priority over the next 30 minutes  Best source	Fun for those times you have time  Takes you to some rarely seen sites that should be seen more often  Also helps organize your personal favorites	Lots of options and control for all Twitter accounts		
45646	Google = My favorite verb

81290	Have been using it more since getting a netbook    i find it requires a decent size screen		
81292	Its simply brilliant  Its based on the same philosophy as 37signalss services  I bet it will have a lot of cool features in the future		
14459	I absolutely adore Mashable! I love that they stay on top of the social media frenzy  keeping us s m addicts sane!	i love the flexibility google docs allows with my financial docs   its all there  no matter what PC im on	I love Firefox  I have converted many friends to it  far away from IE  The customization it has is just fantastic!	I think its a great communication and networking tool  plus  its fun to sit and read through what others are doing at the exact same moment you are!	I often refer to IMDB for info on movies  actors  and upcoming films!	Only been using it a short while  but seems okay so far		
13128	The best way to get your twitter and facebook updates & keep them organised  The layout is simple & clear  you can create groups & it has useful link shortner	Has its flaws but generally speaking a revolution in communication  I use it for work and hobbies  Its great for news debate and its a great networking tool		
71019	The shopping search and cashback feature are great

39744	Very cool  especially avoids need for Real Audio and other crappy players	Extremely useful and brilliantly priced : )	The most popular (?)  Use it daily for all international communications and video conferencing	Definitely one of the best Twitter add on sites	Probably the most use app on our PCs	Good  but prefer to use Twitter directly on the mobile	Very useful if you want to grow your Twitter reach  However  the service can be quite slow	Good for the lazy / photoshop challenged	The definitive movie database  Design looks a bit dated though  and not very interactive	Undeniably the best blog platform  Possibly the most powerful CMS too	Favourite way to discover interesting new sites and while away hours on idle browsing	Extremely handy tool	Very cool  but pointless for daily use	Handy  but not very sleek  Good for tweet categorisation	Interesting  but not the most intuitive interface  Sharing files often requires a bit of hand holding with new users	Definitely the most powerful image editor  Using it for years  and still continue to discover cool new features	Refreshingly good  Doubt it will ever replace Google  but boy do I want it to!	Really neat stuff  and especially handy for quick edits to Flickr images  Would help if they expanded the functionality on Flickr  E g  paintbrush tool	Our desktop Twitter app of choice  Very handy for multiple accounts (office  personal etc) and lots of easy to use functionality without crowding the interface	Usually interesting  I still prefer TechCrunch for getting news first	Still good  Does exactly what it says on the box and has been doing so for almost as long as the Internets been around	Probably the best resource for stock photography	This is their original  and still their best piece of technology ever	Love how much better Office 2007 is than Office XP  Lots more interesting features  Outlook 2007 should have HTML email support though	Significant improvements over XP and Vista  Could be faster to boot  The inability to pin Mini Media Player to taskbar is a fail point	Good  good stuff	Brilliant  Ground breaking	While the mobile browser itself is good  the mobile emulator is absolutely excellent for testing mobile websites	Best business network out there  Could be a bit better in terms of its new addon functionality e g  blog & slideshare integration	The most popular retweet counter being used on popular blogs  Also the most accurate	Probably the simplest and most usable Firefox   Twitter plugin	Brilliant for playing specific tracks  The radio function needs improvement badly	Looks really cool  in terms of function  but I dont like having their brand look so prominent on our site		
7568	youre on it blipping and blipping how can you say that you dont like this site ;)	Gmail is fantastic   I used to do all my works on it !	how cant you love this fabulous website with so many great applications   I never get tired of using it

It is simply good	Its Fine  prevented an iframe attack	I love it in the fact that is that is a open source media player   which is rare	Mostly GarageBand like NINJA90 says	I love it! (Especially the latest version  but it wont broadcast to FriendFeed)

I love the refinements in the user interface in Windows 7  Pinning icons for your most used programs to the taskbar adds sophistication  Sexy  fast and simple!	Wikipedia is a great concept but I feel that it is very much bloated and usefulness as well as reliability can be very questionable!	Mashable is the most amazing social media blog out there and I must confess that I honestly use this on a daily basis!	As a first generation Apple iPhone user who upgraded to the 3G and then 3GS  the OS 3 0 brought so much new features which took the platform to a new level!

15746	Twitter can be so much more than a microblog/social network  If you want  it can condense your whole online life 140 characters at a time	A good blend between other blogging apps and Twitter  Its like blogging express  Couldnt be easier to use yet still suitable for advanced bloggers

90188	Has advantages and disadvantages  chief among the advantages being such great integration with other google service		
10907	There are so many  features on Flock it takes a while to use them correctly  but once learned I dont know how I got by without Flock

10909	I like it and feel that it will be improved in areas where it is not (being in alpha)		
10908	Easy to keep up with certain timely events  such as sports events  but becomes cumbersome at times; often  too many personal tweets from business oriented sites		
90180	I like Buzz and I think well see a lot of improvements as we go along		
9362	I said I love it    :D	its OK   but not so revolutionar as people thinking    simply OK   :)		
9360	I dont like being followed but if I can get a hot deal on sunglasses Im in!		
56271	lets see  but looks it will be veeery good!	cool  very cool  I am new here exploring		
90184	Its a smart  strategic move on Googles part since it allows them to take advantage of their whole platform on Android handsets (duh)		
83898	LOVED THAT SORORITY LIFE !		
10912	i havent tried it much  but so far so good	one of the best photo media sites ive ever come across  i urge everyone to get at least the free account if not the pro account  Its worth it by the way		
82563	i just like it and also can also learn from it :)		
29521	Its great but if youve been around online communication awhile it looks more like a radical re imagining of irc than something new	Mixed feelings  Phishtube good  Tila Tequila  well  journalists who claim twitter is changing our lives should be forced to watch her cam show  :P		
81234	I travel so much  its great to find new places		
13189	Cant make it through the day without a lil Mashable!		
49131	I HAVE JUST JOIN IT SO I HAVE RIGHT NOW NO REVIEW		
74927	Life important thing! :)	Great music community  the largest  library  recommendations and online radio  Bad that free only at USA  UK	This is simple messaging  Can be useful for posting announcements  As for me  i not see much point in using this service as individual	Firefox   this is my internet! The best browser!	Very good service and site usability  but if cancel 10min limit per video  it will be better!	Awesome statistics and software recommendations tracker!		
90176	Has great potential to rule the social networking world		
13195	Look forward to the informative tweets every day!  Petes picture is always worth waking up to as well

13192	Suh weet   Im all about something that keeps me connected to the twitterverse without taking up tons of space		
90178	The Twitter feed isnt live; therefore  people are reading my 2pm tweet at 3 am		
13199	I often find the comments  tips and links to articles very useful  cool   Keep them coming		
13196	Mashable is my favorite resource for keeping up with social media		
93204	Its a really fun app  I just wish more people had it so we could all share the fun!	Its the best blog Ive ever used   I cant wait to try hosting on my own site		
37146	I wasnt much of a Vista fan   in fact  never upgraded to it  only used it on a friends computer once  BUT  Windows 7   Simply Beautiful! Fast & Smooth!	I love the idea behind this  Servers seem a bit sluggish though  ahhh  and a 504 error while trying to post THIS! needs some work

1400	its the juggernaut of web video		
82553	Lost 80% of the songs on my imeem playlists    songs that came from imeem  I despise these myspace dipshts  The big question: What site replaces imeem the best?		
82554	i love the game its great		
38478	Its user interface is awesome  but so is the browser itself  It renders pages accurately  and fast  Trumps Firefox in my opinion		
81220	i need a female friend		
14492	Twitter is addictive  It just gets easier to share thanks to Mobile Tweeting and firefox plugins  Its truly Micro Blogging	This is the only RSS feed colletor service I use  I simply love it the concept of RSS  Would love to see the concept of filters in GReader!		
13161	I have a love/hate with Yelp   love that it uncovers local places that wouldnt get noticed by media  but hate the meaningless star ratings system		
13162	Cant remember what I did before! Tremendous tool for realizing how the planet is not that big and were all very similar		
39795	Its best   but competitors are also performing   Now a days I am also opting for bing		
38464	love good jokes know any		
37135	easy to use easy to view!!		
62972	its the easies way to blog share ideas		
9380	This is really good  For all the stuff that you cant possibly get to read   file them into your Evernote account and access them on Mac  PC  web and iPhone		
8053	Your opinion of this app in 160 characters or less	Robust and clean! Integrated chat  OCD enabling features  Its awesome and constantly getting better		
29508	Facebook is for your real friends  Twitter is for your online friends  Thats the way I look at it		
61639	Im a little slow on it  but am learning pretty quick dont love it dont hate it but im in between		
85611	I have many addons (some uneccesary)  But so  I mustnt search every page  for example i have Gmail Notifier  The search bar is fantastic	I like the @replies in every profile  Also  is very useful the shorten link  daily question and photo features  The bad is that I cant create groups	Love the conversations in realtime  In that sense  is better than Facebook		
13169	It has a lot of useful information		
81251	Useful to keep track of my tasks for various projects  Good reminder functionality		
13167	Lots of good stuff  Lots of good starting points for further inquiry		
38469	i just love it very much		
90197	I think it is the best of the social media outlets  :)		
13170	Its one of my main resources for social media news  lists and howtos		
68289	it is good for me free music we will play  music all day long		
9398	what can i say fb is just another addiction to add to the list   i just cant get enuff  :)	its pretty cool seeing what the rest of the world is up to   its tweet :)		
13176	Mashable is relevant & well written  A great resource for bloggers & marketing professionals  Can count on it to cover the latest in the Web 2 0 world & beyond		
39783	Very fast and simple  Great combination	great app in your iphone  I use it a lot!		
73633	A great browser with an absurd potential  i hope the upcoming versions fix the bloating problems though	The fastest browser option  but still lacks something to become my browser of choice		
38455	Its definitely an excellent browser but I still prefer to use Firefox  Its just what Im used to now		
9390	Facebook is a great tool for professional and personal contact management to keep up with people	Firefox has been my fav browser for years now  Chrome is giving it a run for money on the speed side		
90191	like all these social networks there is a learning curve but Buzz shows great promise still test driving and trying to collapse the overly long threads!		
90194	It seamlessly works with the rest of my google stuff and the connections are savvy and helpful	Google analytics makes me look really smart  Which is quite an accomplishment		
90195	One of the most helpful tools i use	Can be great when you want to keep in touch with friends but can be a perfect tool to waste your time		
34092	Awesome  awesome  awesome	I like it  I like the ad ons  but Ill stick with chrome  its much faster		
10901	The best of the online feed readers  methinks		
2755	OMG TWITTER IS NUMBER ONE!

1421	combines the function of a blog with community extremely well  I love posting my own content as much as reading what others have to say	One of the best things to hit the web since Twitter  Blippr should be integrated with every site  :)	I really wish I had more reason to use virb  The design interface is simply beautiful and elegant	The best source for all your web addiction needs	A beautiful way to display your book collection on the internet	Best tool to stay connected on the internet and off the computer

76043	Well  its only problem is that it really eats up the system memory after some time  and goes slow with that  It really should have many processes  like chrome		
52074	Im adicted to facebook its my fav!		
77377	Totally awesome  one of the things I do the most	Easy to customize theme  awesome functionality  and slick features make this my favorite twitter client	Awesome app for getting directions  Totally	Great for sharing photos	Best browser  the one I use the most  Cant beat the addons!		
12818	Great money management tool for the every person  Manage your finances through the web or through your iPhone		
1476	I use gmail and google hosted email for my domains   What I like best is the mobile integration and the ability to get ALL my Google stuff on my iPhone		
91668	Im so addicted to facebook  Im on it 24 7 like yea!		
5836	Great  but has the downside of clogging up your system the longer you use it	The best option for watching and uploading HD and a nice change from all the dross on YouTube	Its getting there  but perhaps feels a bit stale   Spotlight search is the best though	Good lord  this thing is consuming me	Really? Does it need to be explained why Google is so great?	Gets a very bad rep  but works fine for many peoples basic browsing needs  The security holes do need to be fixed however	Throw away your phone  its redundant	Fan fucking tastic	At last  a method of statistically proving my music taste is superior to your music taste	The fact it is so often accurate is terrifying proof that we will soon all be killed by robots		
64052	I luv it so much  This is wonderful experience to meet so many people in the world		
68422	Its basically the new God		
39044	Awesome app  Mini blog and so much much more :D	Biggest timesucker ever  but I love how it doesnt make you feel bad for that  :D		
42691	im new to the twitter thing		
65399	I watched the wave video and really liked it alot! Im just mad i havnt got an invite yet!	I like it  its ok  I wish it had more options like adding game app! Im new to Twitter maybe i havnt figured it all out yet?		
1492	This is my primary Email client    wouldnt live with out it :D	Come on Google is like the blood of the internet   How doesnt like it ?	Who doesnt like Facebook ?? Isnt everyone on it no matter if you like it or not ?	It is a good and stable browser   Not perfect but what browser is?	I really dont know why  or what to use it for   I just know that I love it    ;D		
56440	eu adoro mto tdo isso        Facebook Ã© tdo de bom		
77360	its fast  adaptable  reliable   what more is there to say?		
78690	hey guys finally i got the time to log on

77362	FUCK TOM! HE BOUGHT THE IMEEM WEBSITE ! FUCK! HE COMBINE! FUCK! TOM MYSPACE MUSIC IS FUCK! ONLY WANT MONEY! FUVK! MY PROFILE GONE SHIT ! MY ULOAD SONG! SHIT!		
5849	use IMDB ALL the time	has considerable limitations at present	alternately wonderful and annoying as hell	kinda weird and limited	good is getting better	dont use it as much as one might think I would  use Google Maps online much more	some of it is sort of Vader tho	my 1st string browser   crashes and is a mem hog at times tho	seems awfully bloated but hey gotta synch my Ipod	one of the best things about the internet	helps make the machine work better	occasional annoyances   if I find out its the one making the annoying bu whup sounds I cant trace its going in the trash	dont use it as much as blip fm right now but might later	every time a feed breaks it spits it out and the feed has 2 b readded  annoying amount of babysitting		
32412	 OH THIS COOL YEH YOU GOT THE RIGHT STUFF GIVE IT TO ME BABY   NOW TALKING OH OH I JUST BLIPPED MY SELF  EXCUSE ME!		
78699	much better than baidu	fresh and simple  especialli no adds		
1488	Alongside TechCrunch  Mashable is up there in my top blogs to read  Its great for finding new information on some of your favorite social networks	Google Wave  is a revolutionary way of communicating  But its no replacement for Email  Its far from it  Currently Wave is just another new Social Network		
12828	I have approx 550 feeds and i love that I can tag feeds of interest and add sites to my RSS notes which use the same tags Its the ultimate tool for web research		
90328	Tendulkar is very great personality &such abig guy		
12822	Really easy and simple to use	Seamless cross platform  cross browser  multi workstation file sharing		
65393	thanks twitter 4 giving me apportunity to join with new friends		
94721	The best of anything you could ever think of  Useful  respectful  trendy  geeky  mobile    and the list goes on!		
90363	Talks about subjects that other people dont want or prefer us not to talk about  I appreciate the nice clean subjects  Nothing crude  either  Even corp s don		
91693	The best gift in the history of gift giving!!!! Love it  How did i ever live without it		
70750	really twitter is a good site to expressur views	Follow me on twitter:  http://www twitter com/apurvgourav		
67107	Gmail is amazing     I use it for everything    literally		
90366	use it everyday :)		
77391	Most practical app to manage and organize RSS feeds !		
45719	It is the technology that will refine the telegraphic abilities of our brain and the receptors in our cells in ways we cannot even imagine yet    It is Amazing!		
77394	Endless entertainment and information		
76063	Ok  I used to totally love it  Now that I guess myspace bought it  it  SUCKS  I guess Ill find another music/video site that has not sold out to myspace		
77398	Excellent for projects and collaboration where teams are distributed indifferent cities and contintents  Finding it difficult to convert some people tho	I have an andriod phone for over 1year & it just gets better Just yesterday  i purchased an iphone so that i can compare them  iPhone is great but Android smart	I used to use Flickr all the time but after my Pro membership lapsed  I found myself using Picasa more because of the offline and online capabilities		
77399	I just want to say goodbye to the Windows world  and Google looks likely to help me do that  I will never forgive Microsoft for the pile of s***t called Vista		
94716	Just started now  its begining but i started liking it http://www fashno com		
69760	I love google wave i can manage my project on it with my colleagues		
70749	Its just beta so far  but I think it looks cute  Though  I was kind of hoping that it would be able to kill msn  But Im having doubts		
68444	Firefox is a very fast browser  is supporting neat all sorts of programming languages and works on every operating system very good  Its just the best browser		
70767	youtube is on of the best websites ever!		
45701	Super fast  simple UI  in my opinion an amazing browser  which is only lacking in plug in support		
91683	Checking out the Blippr Review pluggin		
91689	Better organized and faster than Hotmail  Prefer it over any other email hosting company	The only video site I use  because its got videos for just about anything		
90358	Cant imagine life without without gmail!!	the most entertaining website!! all of us would have been so deprived without it!		
5873	Twitter gets a lot of my attention	Gluing content together from the fragmented Social Media scene is important for #lifestreaming   FriendFeed com makes that easy  Just needs duplicate detection!		
90357	its just so easy to use  but it would be nice to be able to use lists  because now its not very clear with all the posts in one big list		
56461	FB stay connected with friends and watch those people you never really liked try to be your friends		
40015	i use google in daily conversation    its become a part of our culture		
90350	Great news and comment  and some great functionality  Especially love ncluds new Mashable app  although some sort of mashable:// URL would be nice!		
3208	Great open source vector graphics editor  good alternative for Ilustrator	Twitter seems to be really taking off   Like it because it is (still) so simple and basic	Prefer this over Twinkle and Twitterfon  even if its a payed app	Transparent file sync  backup and sharing solution  Comes with 2Gb free	Small and efficient  what more do you want?	Very simple solution for remembering things on the web you want to check out later	My favorite twitter client for the desktop	Great webbased messenger  supports msn  gtalk  yahoo  icq etc  Now with a cool iphone app to make it even better!	Keep your text/audio/video notes everywhere  Has web  desktop and iphone clients	Plays almost everything without the need for codecs and stuff		
55135	i want to join with twitter		
81401	The new CV creator is just great !		
30694	Best browser out there so far  I wish Safari would learn from them		
12804	My favorite comment system but I maybe slightly bias   heh		
30690	Started out sceptical using Twitter  but can say now that I am addicted to it  As Mickey D would say loving it		
55138	its mah first tym so lets see		
56465	its just great  info in the moment!		
90348	love it  its new and does need lots of work but im positive google will work out all the issues it has and make it a major player		
88038	Best by far  no problems at all	Very easy in use  functional no extra flashy things  Like it a lot	Very interesting and educational  latest reviews  news etc for me personally the best social media blog		
88036	clean  simple interface and functionality    Gmail is great		
88065	I LIKE IT BECAUSE EVERYTIME A NEW SONG CUMS OUT ITS ON THERE AND U CAN LEARN DANCES		
5881	Its hard to tell right now  but the integration of several services in one place is potentially useful  I still post more Twitter updates than Buzz ones though		
40002	Lean and mean  Fast and sprightly  Well done  Google	About the only Reader that works really well  Google does it better than anyone else  Except havent found how to rename Labels  Strange blip	I am sticking to Firefox because it helps me experience the web better  Chrome is close but Firefox breaks boundaries on what you can do with a browser		
94746	One of the greatest think tank in the world		
90388	Interesting  powerful but messy (UI & all the stuff that has been discussed since the release)		
56473	isnt it fascinating  thats what we need from time to time		
82758	I used it a week  but seemed one of not that many    Twitter  facebook are simply too popular    Twitter already location aware and facebook will follow  march		
61822	Twitter   my fav place to go  when in depressed!		
82759	yup   while it was not fighting with my phishing filter it was great		
81437	another fantastic Tool from my beloved Google  Tkank You :D		
49290	IF YOU FOLLOW THE RIGHT PEOPLE THEN ITS A GREAT INFORMATION FLOW TOOL see who I follow @Globalcide		
81433	Only Bill Gates on twitter     mrrrfff		
8902	The fastest meaning of sharing informations		
70769	Very interactive and user friendly  Interactions are easy and informative  ITs got cool applications too to keep you hooked up		
30688	Better than IE  not as good as Firefox or Chrome  but Unite puts it in another league entirely!		
8903	Im chatting with Pete Cashmore now and he suggested I check out blippr   Im going to rate Twitter  b/c obviously  I think its awesome		
43983	Excellent is all what I can say about this  :)	What can I ask more from Gmail  The best e mail around without a doubt		
94731	My tech bible :)		
68466	The Google Wave preview takes a little getting used to  It will only come into its own when the floodgates open and everyone you know/work/share has access	Windows 7 an improvement on Vista which caused me no end of pain since its release  The hibernation works properly too  Still prefer OSX for my primary machine		
8920	Twitter has become a commodity for some of us  Nevertheless  I think  should Facebook get better  it might be able to render twitter obsolete	The whole thing with IE security holes is so misleading  FF has even more holes  Chrome has holes  They all have  IE is at least as fast and at least as safe	I love GMail  But I think there is so much more that Google should do with mail  Google just is not cutting edge anymore		
70782	Functionality is great however somewhat limiting on layouts   I also dont like that its not integrated with AdSense  however integration in general is very good		
89380	I love the games & being able to connect with old & new friends alike  I keep UTD w/current events & learn about new things  All around a great site		
43980	I have something to read thanks to the useful people I follow  Its always interesting to have news on tech world in an efficient  filtered and workless way  :)		
42656	Missed the start of the new season of Hells Kitchen Caught up on Hulu  Its free; its great	Cool way to browse your pics; the 3D view/scroll is smart  Some nice GUI features too  Like it  although non essential in the grand scheme of things	Love it & love it more now that theres a Blackberry app for it	Without question  the best browser there is  Add ons and extensions for everything	Nice app & social tool for managing Twitter & Facebook  Some nifty extras as well		
43988	i just started bt hey

83190	Google is da best search engine		
66611	awesome free app   everyone needs this if you have an iPhone/iPod touch	just got this app   love it   returning to my love of music   this app helps    and I highly recommend it for just sitting back and taking the music in

88880	Fast browser with support for latest technologies  No longer supports some widely used technologies though	Best OS from Microsoft so far		
80907	Firefox blows goatz		
48854	Firefox made me switch from what was then my favourite browser   IE  How little I knew	Love it  Much better than the iPhone	I resisted it for so long and now I wonder why	Great  but clunky  Would like to see Facebook style photo layout (click for next etc) and more space for free accounts	Just brilliant  Unbeatable	Gmail revolutionised email		
11591	First app Ive ever actually paid for   Love that it handles my multiple twitter accounts		
8941	Its really hit the mainstream media recently  I use it to find out and echo topics of interest to my professional life  Its been great so far		
10260	Great software even in beta! TweetDeck gives Twitter an IM like interface with alerts and a slew of features including translating tweets!		
67954	One of the Best apps out there  And deffinatily the best im client	Works good  many platforms nothing else will work on	Kicks firefoxs ass	i like the new streaming function		
11590	Brilliant  Im not saying its better than Google  but perhaps better than Google News (/any other news website)  :)		
47520	Unlike Myspace  Facebook is populated largely by people who go by their real names  Its great getting back in touch with old classmates  coworkers  and friends		
10262	Awesome backgrounds! Check mine here http://twitter com/iSnake		
67959	Fast  lightweight  secure   What else does one need in a browser		
34215	good way to kill time  and very useful in finding random things	i like the idea but still i dont get the big picture  google creating its own facebook?	vary good client		
35545	Got hooked with Twitter already  in fact I get to open my Twitter page more than any other social network sites I have  It gives more info  etc		
34213	I love it and use feedly on Firefox to read it as a magazine		
86218	like their shares moved a lot in the right direction  north ^		
11595	The browser of choice on my Mac  Despite everything  no other browser can match safari when Im on my home turf	The idea is great  Problem is  noone I know is using it  So for me  its just a comment system that works pretty much just like any other  Shame	The hub of my digital life! The smart playlists  iTunes U and Podcast support makes this the go to app for all my listening related desires!	The problem with relaying social network information is duplicates  so its less of a fit for me since I started twittering in addition to facebook	So ubiquitous  I just cant imagine my life without it anymore	Not accessible enough  though    I never remember to go there  Good for killing a couple of hours  though!	I tried to stay away for a long time    But I finally got it  Like the new facebook stream  only more alive!	The benchmark against which all other web browsers have to measure themselves  When Im on my Mac  I still use Safari  though    Firefox everywhere else!	This is my brain on super strong  knowledge increasing  free from all sideeffects except the addiction drugs  Any questions?	Another all pervasive service  Too bad the social networking functions totally sucks	Keeping track of all my songs for new and interesting music recommendations  or listening to my library when I am away is real nice	I wish I had photographed myself when realizing this wasnt just about the web apps    Books  games  movies  music    This is soooo awesome!	Google might be king of search  but whenever I need movie info  this is the place to go	It is an amazing step up from Tiger    The reference OS	The first webmail client I use over a desktop version  I miss a native iPhone app to be able to use tags in a more intuitive way  though	Now if I could only keep up a blog for longer than two weeks		
36872	Informative  A reliable source for the latest innovations and trends in social media		
15953	But I havent devoted time to become adept with it	Great people can buzz you on your mobile  without the app even being opened	Went crazy at the start trying to get it via proxy  Now Miro has filled the void for the most part	Keeps my various web identities organized and just a click away  Support are very responsive also  Would love if Nimbuzz and Digsby partnered :)	Its my media center of choice now  just wish it didnt crash so much !	But the whole music thing is such a commodity  There are a zillion ways to be close to music  but the quality of music being put out leaves much to be desired :		
44492	Best collection of high production and commercial video available free on the internet  but unfortunately most of it isnt viewable outside of the United State		
88875	Twitter is an objective proof that the world is flat  Few words  learning to get to the point		
8932	Can do a lot and if not  there is a plugin that can  Great stuff		
8933	Ive been using Spotify more than iTunes for the last month	After two years of use Twitter has become one of my most important tools for communication  A great place to share ideas	The best web based email Ive ever used and an integral part of my daily life		
11596	not microsoft  what else do I need to say?		
87543	You tube is it  the other day I was listening to alternative music of the 80 s  such as the Chamelions echo And The BunnyMen and Exct    blew my mind!   ro

8937	Perfect solution to handle my stuff I love and discover more what I probably like		
67964	Its a perfect sites for social networking  Having new interrelationship with different kinds of people		
12891	Before I thought it was useless  Now I know Twitter is a good way to stay in touch with people you know  to meet new friends and to gain/share knowledge	Great  fast and easy tool	I checked out a lot of blogging tools  but they just dont manage to catch up with the latest trends like WP  Besides the user interface is just great	I chose Seesmic especially for its powerful multiple account management  Great tool!	Really simple and a lot of choice to give your Twitter page your own look and feel		
8950	Best app ever! :)	Coolest app after gmail! OK  lets sfeed some stuff now :)		
8951	I love the way you can combine clothes into sets		
27901	too good to be true :D		
47518	Free  easy to use   syncs with iPhone	Great tool for short stuff	Great browser with loads of customizable stuff	Great browser  snappy		
15928	Fast  fast fast and furious		
34204	is a interesting page ilike it		
31175	Chrome is in its infancy  and as such  I cant really judge  but it is bite the back of your hand fast  just needs the extendability of FF	Great comprehensive music library  fast streaming  easy to share playlists  The best streaming app available	Fast  extendable  easy to use  Just the best browser IMHO	I use Wikipedia every day  amazing how many different and obscure topics it has information on	Enormous library of songs  just choose one and listen  easy	Great site for the latest news on Twitter and other social networking sites  always useful  always informative  always up to date	Tooth meltingly fast  great for social networking and keeping up to date with feeds and news  Flock has now replaced Firefox as my favourite browser		
31174	love it  getting better everyday	i wish they would adopt some of chromes design (button positioning a lot better with chrome)		
80941	This is my first day but i love it already   Its quick and easy to use  WOOHOO at last lol		
31177	I use Chrome for regular browsing  but NO other browser comes close to the excellent extensions of FF!!!		
35530	I was using v 0 3 & that worked great! v0 4 (on 2 PCs) runs really slow! Cant seem to get it to work properly		
11561	Twitter is where you can talk to a crowd yet listen to select individuals based on who they are  who they listen to and what theyre talking about  @gelbendorf		
92911	Didnt think much about it at first  but have been having a lot of fun with it within the past week or so!	Once I got on Facebook I never went back to MySpace  and I havent missed the MySpace clutter or spammers since!

95184	i like facebook because its very nice to talk with your friends and to make other new friends		
31168	My one and only bookmarking service  Nothing beats it	Best blogging platform I found  Not as good as it should be  but definitely better than TypePad and Blogger!	Forget TV  Reading my feeds is a much better way to waste time	Best for Gmail and Google apps  Not as good as Firefox yet  but getting there	Remind me   why are there icons on the desktop? and whats the start menu for? Oh  right  some people dont use launchy	Outlook? Whats outlook?

55995	just the best in internet music	Firefox is by far the most practical and functional web browser ! (2)		
668	Best  Browser  Ever  Seriously  it does everything right  is wonderfully customizable  and is more stable and secure than IE	Digsby has replaced Trillian  Pidgin  and all other IM clients for me  Its easy to use and very feature rich	The best BitTorrent client Ive found  Clean UI  easy to use  very configurable  and tiny to boot	Not the end all be all of social networks that its sometimes claimed to be  but still useful for keeping tabs on distant acquaintances	Not a bad little browser  and its got an interesting architecture  Not perfect  though; I still prefer Firefox and its flexibility		
11573	Por fin un cliente para Twitter en Windows que es atractivo  (Lamentablemente tengo que tener Firefox abierto)		
11572	us it every day  Like to have more group functions		
8955	Simplicity and fun     meet your own kind of people there       Marko

For making elegant looking documents quickly and easily  iLife is the way to go  Its templates are such that you can make them your own with ease	Until I get my own helicopter  Google Maps satellite view will do nicely	I prefer this to Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes  for instance  since I can see my friends ratings  Really like the Web 2 0 features of the site  too	I remember gleefully turning to a random page in my old World Book Encyclopedia when I was a kid  I get that same joy from Wikipedia today

As someone whos not comfy with face to face interactions  I loved how FB helped me break the ice among my colleagues by sharing snarks and jokes  :)	It was love @ 1st sight when it loaded my FB games effortlessly  Now I cant browse online without it! I love the speed and its omnibar!	My go to site for quick infos   assignments  celeb bios  comparison of apps features  rumored devs  movie summaries/spoilers  etc  Beware of grammar potholes

43099	I cant believe I didnt find this before  I dont know where I was when BJ Thomas was at the top of his game I guess they didnt show videos then like now		
9423	Use it for sharing sites with friends  not so much for tagging itself		
95134	Who doesnt like YouTube?  Yeah  theres a lot of crap on it  and it can be glitchy  but if your subscribed to the right people  can be a good way to burn time	Very nice  gets the job done when it comes to getting the word out   How fun it is also really depends on who you follow   Open APIs is excellent too	Its ok  it needs to have a lot more content to be excellent though   I really appreciate the convenience  but what I want to watch is never on there	Dropbox is one of the most fantastic pieces of online software that i have found   No flash drive? No problem  use Dropbox	Its ok  but all these light boxes are a bit annoying	TweetDeck is AWESOME!  The iPhone/iPod version has some bugs and the Facebook connectivity needs some UI help but other than that    GREAT!

13202	Better than other Twitter apps Ive tried  but I havent really pushed it yet  Only 1 account and dont use the favorites feature	Easy to pull in various IM accounts and social networking tools  Runs a little slow  but simplifies my life		
48781	This is the application that will change my world		
38504	Its great  As simple or as complex as you want	Chromes become my default browser on my Windows machines  I love the minimalist design  I just wish theyd make Mac and Linux versions already

One of the best for planning your daily activities  Love it!		
10182	If only I had come up with such a great idea	Ive tried just about every desktop app for Twitter and this is by far my favorite	Best photo sharing site ever	Its a shame that its being overrun with spam  Its making me like Craigslist less and less  but it still has a place in my heart	Hulu    interfering with my productivity since 2007	Vimeo is the YouTube for respectful  creative  serious users  Love it	I love the recommended music station

9427	not even a day using it and im already hooked :)	perfect source for the daily drops of socialweb info =D	cause the whole separate bars when something goes wrong thing really makes a difference :)		
83145	Its a great IM client but it needs a light version so it doesnt consume CPU  Also  with some accounts  they then to have connection fails	As much as I like playing Mafia Wars  that pretty much sums it up  That was funny		
15873	I use the Tweetie application for my iPhone   quick  light and easy		
9428	Like Firefox but using Chrome 95% of the time now because its so much faster

14515	Super fast and good on memory  but until it gets extensions Im a firefox user		
14516	ridiculously addictive  real time gossip machine!	The perfect music library! Works brilliantly even with Windows  but once you get use it on the Mac   theres no going back!	Gives great recommendations and provides a clean looking library to see what youve *really* been listening too	My favourite free twitter app for iPhone/iPod touch  Easy to use and simple design	Theres just nothing else you can compare it too! Runs beautifully  looks brilliant  I just have nothing bad to say!		
11488	can use for social good  Yeah!!

10159	Bring on the plugins/extensions/add ons!

I use many Google apps	A poor mans Photoshop  I use it al the time :)	Simply the best phone i have ever had	Looks great  i saw the Google Wave presentation and it will definately change the way we do things

87527	I love the openess of Android   but it seriously needs an iTunes like media manager  I miss iTunes U from my iPhone alot too	Google Reader is awesome    especially now that it has 2 way commenting via buzz	Brilliant framework  Simply the best CMS out there	Love having a social app in my gmail   but it needs a few more features and tweaks for me to love it		
31088	Initially  Google Buzz is devoid of all the nonsense that has become a mainstay in twitter  I think the convos and topics are a lot more informative	Ease of use and a clean interface make it a favorite with me!		
84496	THE e mail service to use	Twitter is the best social networking tool at the moment	Google owns the world		
83164	I can no longer imagine a world where there is no Google =D

82663	Hulu has replaced cable and satellite in my house  but Im all about saving so we will see how long this free network remains just that!	I am always telling other about Skype! Everyone in my house has their own account! If you use paypal though  only 1 paypal account per skype account		
30660	Looks great  no ads! It is so streamlined and lets me keep everything in one place  instead of a dozen!	Awesome site! Tons of tips for software and everyday life	Google Chrome is great! With a larger developer community and a better extension API  this could really take off  By far  one of the best web browsers around!	I like it  but I like the FriendFeed layout better   No ads  slick interface and better realtime  Facebooks good because so many people use it	Really nice interface  clean and awesome real time  But I like FriendFeed better since I can post to Twitter from it and keep all my stuff in one place!	With time  this could replace email  but it needs time to mature and have a developer community grow before it gains widespread adoption  Best for collaboration

8140	Play any song  playlists  autoplay  its awesome   I expect theyll need to create a revenue model soon  though   Is it legal?  Not sure	Very cool aggregator of online media   I wish there was a search for a given show/movie across sources	Whoops  got a few NSFW pages while killing time between coding stints	I really like the idea and the website works relatively well  but it is cluttered and was a little frustrating to get going	Works fantastically  very polished player  but the number of movies is limited and the search is pretty awful

9481	Sometimes I find myself reading Wikipedia for hours	Post SP1 Vista is very usable  but as many others I am waiting for Windows 7	Decent website  but their interface really needs a makeover	Its a great resource  but quality of comments on the site leaves a lot to be desired	Best web based email solution hands down!	I miss all Firefox extensions	I like their interface  but I wish they support RSS for books in my shelf  Their community features could also use some tuning  Its still a great website thou!	New user here  I love the idea and websites interface  Good job!	I wish they supported Opera and Google Chrome better	I like it (specially the HD option)  but I am not an avid user	Great IM client  I love how it integrates everything I care about in one small window  Interface is really minimalistic and thats the way I like it	Good email client  but I still prefer Gmail	Rediscovered Last fm again and this time I am not going away :)	I like application and advertising  platforms	I used to love Opera  but their support for Ajaxy websites like Google docs  Google Reader made me switch to Firefox	I like their programming section	I am still exploring it  but I like what I see	I like their drag and drop support

81352	 I like it because its quick and easy to use		
30649	Fast  secure  free and simply works		
68375	I still prefer IE to the rest of the options		
90297	Its a great way to communicate with SHORT messages to a vast audience		
37260	hmm still waiting for an invite		
8165	The webmail interface is great  but I use my own email client (Evolution) since you can  Free IMAP support is awesome!	A great example of the potential of open source software  Powerful yet pretty easy to use	I still prefer Firefox  and Im waiting for Linux support  but its OK  Each tab and plug in as its own process is a great idea as processors get more cores	Simple  well organized bittorrent client  I use it on Ubuntu	Overall  its probably the best browser available  I love how easy it is to add extensions  And it works great on Linux!	I like how it uses less flash than pandora  It seems like it gives me more control  The user interface could use a few changes  though

Make sure you get the updates	Worlds best browser? Sure! Dabbled with Opera (not bad) but keep coming back to the Fox  The add ons should only be used sparingly (I think)	Of the four bookmarking services I have used I keep coming back to delicious  Still the most reliable! Greasemonkey scripts increase its friendliness

Simply the best email in existence	Does what it needs to do  Its light  simple  and it works	Works a lot better than iChat & I like how it links my AIM and Yahoo accounts together  Very nice	It used to be better & is now overcrowded with useless apps but a great way to keep in touch with friends and share photos	I only use it about 1000 times a day	The best time waster ever created	Good resource for social media news & info  Keeps me updated on the latest Twitter scams	Perfection!

40933	Google Chrome rocks! When Chrome is multiplatform  it shall rise and take over from every other browser!	I love Google! I use it daily to surf around the internets		
66706	I use Gmail several times a day  My favorite email client  especially powerful with an iPhone	I appreciate Twitter for its brevity; I long for better stream management capabilities in the web client  Looking forward to experimenting with lists		
40925	Best way I know to both contribute to and watch the conversations on the web		
50363	Tweetie on mac & iPhone   simples :)		
84598	Just one simple question What are you doing? and I am still answering that question with joy and fun		
76973	undeniably  one of the best blogs on social media! Im a daily reader!		
88954	I think you tube is hott!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!		
40929	TweetDeck rocks   Its flexible  customizable  helps you organize the tweets you follow  and it happens to be beautiful and cross platform		
76975	I just love Evernote its fantastic  Simple to use  work perfect in my Iphone   Eduardo Ovies		
8217	Superior to IE  Safari is still tops for Mac and I prefer Google Chrome for the PC  Firefox has fun Apps though		
8218	After all these years  still the leader when it comes to finding what you want	Love it for its social features  but still cant give up its older brother	Would be my favorite messenger if not for its horrid memory usage  Good  but not great	Makes keeping track with friends and family as easy as logging on    and keeps out all that unwanted CSS that Myspace lets through! ;)	The best way to keep track of my listening habits  Invaluable!	Absolutely  hands down  the greatest email service in existence  And its not even commercial (yet)!	Great way to broadcast pretty much anything	A great service that is very helpful when finding new apps to try!	My favorite when it comes to news    Digg is nice too  but nothing beats reddits community! ;)	Well the community could use some work  but when youre the most popular video service on the web youre bound to attract some kids  Great video sharing service	A great way to blog!	Im loving this so far  very intuitive and very fun!	Favorite torrenting application  supported by a wide variety of trackers  very fast and efficient    Invaluable for file sharing!	Great messenger  if not a little limited by its protocol usage		
54729	Ubuntu gives me that warm  Im not a slave to big corporations feel every time it boots up  I like the interface  and its simplicity	What needs to be said about Firefox? If you use it  you know why its great  If not  you dont know what youre missing	Definitely my favorite torrent program  Lightweight and stable!	An app I discovered moments ago  Im already hooked! This will certainly become one of my most frequently visited web sites!	Windows 7 = Like Vista  but better  Love the new taskbar!		
38614	very interesting and keeps u updated in real time		
48890	myspace is like da coolest web site like no one hates it in my whole life one preson has told me myspace was wack		
13336	Love my Android phone  could not love it any more unless it brought me breakfast in bed  And to iPhone fanboys I have one thing to say: concurrent processes	Easiest and most flexible blog platform   bar none		
15999	Most famous streaming service website  but they deleted some Athene videos	But Chrome is better  IMO		
47559	Its almost like Google has a hand in every app I use these days  Email  browser  docs  maps  FBs not far behind  These guys want to rule the internets	Best browser Ive ever used  bar none  The add ons and customization are what make Firefox extremely powerful and useful	I love it  but I need to use it like any normal person do   limit friends to close friends and family and do my networking in groups and pages		
73009	Still the best news source for web2 0 news	I really like Google Readers simplicity   just wish there was a better mobile version		
73006	*sigh* i cant believe imeem is gone   i had so many favorite playlists		
10270	Evernote is amazing and the free edition is a steal! It can be a light CRM  a brain dump  a GTD tool  a project document collection and much more		
48885	Its kool but sumXs u get bored:=]]		
8236	The most usefull social network		
62356	prolly zi best    but big and scary		
75663	i like and new come to join Twitter		
66719	but I have always problems with updates (themes and plugins stop working)  Is this an eternal BETA process? WTH!		
22250	Its making my life a lot easier	Testing out Blippr   hope this works		
87656	Greatest blog on the net!	a better tool than twitter		
34244	After of 32 000 rankings of over 3 000 titles I am still addicted  Damn I love this site		
88987	by far the best E Mail Service	best browser on the market so far  megafast  newest html4 technology in it  Flash Support  comes right with windows :) ROFLMAO just kiddin	who could live without it? only thing that sux is that those article writing people think they are the masters of language  and who is not sux	my first twitter client  needsupdates!	If youre in it  you wont want out	pretty nice stuff  great community  Google Picasa is way better	Probably the best mobile operating system in the world  Using an iPhone though		
15964	I really love it  When i have some issue  They always give me good solution		
10277	Its what Im using now  but theres definitely some awkward niggly issues that need ironing out before I commit to it	Until 2 days ago I used it without question  Now  after a load of crashes  Im looking elsewhere		
43196	Gmail has changed the worled arounf  remember the days when yahoo was giving just 5 mb http://www umeedastrology com		
10276	a true cool and incredibly usefull application  especially if u use a PC next to your MB	ideal to share docs between multiple pc/macs and users		
88983	Tiger Woods ve http://organizebrnckvvtmllttrhaberi blogspot com/ birarada		
14636	Easy to use  Great for posting links to media and stealing stuff off others  See my own page  for instance  (Cool layout   but nicked from someone else)		
38605	I really like firefox  it works really well  has a ton of cool apps like firebug and is really customizable		
10280	Ive been on a lot of blogging platforms for the long term  and tried even more  Xanga is different because it rocks the community aspect more than the others	It can be extremely useful  but I honestly dont use it very much  I wish it were used on more sites	TweetDeck is awesome  Its the application I go to for my main Twitter account  I had to use something else for two days and realized how much I depend on it	When it comes to multiprotocol messengers for OS X  I swear by Adium  I had to thank my friend profusely for telling me about it	Seems to have changed quite a bit since it hit mainstream and everyone jumped the bandwagon  but change doesnt have to be bad  does it? Ill wait and see	I was on this site a lot before  but I dont remember why I stopped  (Changed computers  maybe?) It was fun to use and interesting  Try it yourself!	I adore Last fm  I really do  Now  if I could figure out a way to get it to scrobble songs from Pandora  Id be set	Its easy to use  and works with Last fm	Microblogging in video form! I dont use it as often as Id like  because the lighting in here isnt that great at night  and I dont have a camera when Im out	I love Pandora  Adore it  Its sad that it doesnt seem to work outside the US anymore  because it is awesome	I dont use it as much as I use FF  but I havent ever had any major problems with it	I use TweetDeck for my main account  but I still swear by Twhirl for the ability to access more than one Twitter account at once  (Plus Seesmic!)	Probably the biggest site for videos  but its becoming harder and harder to find videos that havent been taken down for one reason or another		
63693	hi             friend i am umesh chandra rao		
48875	Keeps me current with my circle of friends

63698	Easy to keep in contact with people over great geographical divides	Awesome and keeps getting Awesome er		
27953	Extremely handy when trying to find your way in a foreign city		
96596	Ive used Mashable for Social Media research and it is INVALUABLE!		
34230	Voting on movies is a no brainer  Already addicted and struggle to pull myself away  Cant imagine when the site is enhanced and more movies are added		
26626	I used to love it  until all the send me this and super throw that started  Now it just seems like more games and ads than anything else	Simple API  inexpensive and all you really need  Tried Twitteriffic too  but this ended up being my ultimate go to for managing four twitter accounts on the go	Simple  to the point  put your ideas out there and listen to others  If you have good content  people follow you  Simple  until @oprah showed up that is	I dont dislike it  but it might just be my user ignorance in that its basically just another app that overlaps  You just pick your fave to use		
87649	Lots of good features		
39929	It keep life going and running		
86317	twitter is cool but i dont understand how you make money on it   HELP!

87643	Nice tool with great feature		
53416	Its my chat client  twitter client  facebook client and all my social networks client  Really amazing creation  Cant live without it  Get it you wont regret!	I am not a real fan of Facebook  so alternatives are always good  Buzz a but confusing & slow for now  but it has a good prospect to grow		
87644	Wow  Cool one :)		
87641	Very cool service that complements Twitter		
10288	Loving it  Before I tried thwirl and tweetdeck  but somehow did not work for me  DestroyTwitter does  And off course created my own theme very easily		
83281	It is evil in sense  but God its addicting ;)		
36082	Tried Chrome  love Firefox  constant updates from a loving community  Whats not to love		
88085	Best email client	Google is my favorite company		
67144	Its the most simplest and easy to use blogging platform  Also there is so much more a non designer  non technical person can do with blogger than others		
92100	Needs more love  not as bad as they say		
93438	please invite me (amanda orangejeruk@gmail com) thanks   :)		
40101	Recently found this blog  has some fun stuff on it  A good one to check out	Reliable  I really dont have any complaints  Might not be the most feature packed complex app  but works well for me	So awesome  And makes planning trips fun!	Super easy to use  Good design  only if it worked right all the time	Be smart about how you use it and its an awesome resource  Great place to get some quick info	Easy  Integrated  Fresh  Innovative  Most importantly  very few hassles	I could watch the HD videos all day long	Extremely useful  I always find myself checking up on actors and films  Great resource		
15144	Holy crap this place is addictive!	Spotify is awesome  Seriously  Free  easy to access  legal music  You have no excuse not to get it   Well  unless its unavailable in your country		
93436	cool image search!!		
15143	Just started using Blippr quite like it		
70792	Gmail is fresh  I love its simplicity and its easy to use  Im still figuring out some cool stuff about it today!	I dont know  I have mixed feelings about Twitter  Its fun and stuff  but I dont like the hype around it		
59520	HEY GUYZ IM NEW HERE		
61842	fast  responsive  and works like a browser should work!		
36086	I like Firefox  because it is safer  faster  and has more current updates than I E  8		
48060	Anyone know How I can add a blog to my website www potgieterfamily co za		
29783	imeem is the place to find music of any style!!!		
29782	WAOO COOL xXD		
81452	The Best and Funnest stuff in the World is on You Tube!	Great site to communicate with friends and family!		
82785	As an Elite member  I think you can guess that I love my Yelp  You will to  Join today and get your Yelp on!	My professional home  It rocks!	Duh! Best search ever!!	Best break from work  Thumbs up!		
2949	The best multi protocol IM I have used	I like the new Safari 4 (beta)	The best Torrent client I have ever used		
93428	Great! Have a soft spot of this googlemaps    Many features are updates and useful for searching	Excellent! Awesome! Terrific! Speechless! Its better n faster than window	Hohoho    Very easy    Almost everyday using it!	Speechless! Really easy to use and having fun with this blogging	Nothing to say  except awesome!!!		
30786	Its so relevant to the new economy;a real must for savvy marketers & advertisers promoting products  services  and thought streams		
48062	Currently really neat in my opinion	Been using Firefox for about four years  Love it and the competition its encouraged in the browser world	Its pretty good  Paving the way for more TV to end up on the Internet where it belongs  =)		
30788	Love that columns sync between this & desktop over air; wish sync kept track of whats been read though  Anyone figure out a way to do this?		
67158	No black background! It comes on too hard  Seesmic is mild and nice		
67155	Evernote makes my various computer sessions   at home  work or university   on a desktop  laptop or iPhone   and with or without internet access   all connecte		
72502	Awesome simple project management tool for freelancing  even includes invoicing!		
8265	Extensions    need I say more? Also  anything is better than IE	kind of unorganized  wish it had a search like twitter		
41421	Best email service  period	Great search  great company  great services   Google apps for your domain is my saviour		
15155	Awesome   Got me social	The bestest  awesome  free  inventive		
9599	Tweetie is my favorite Twitter app for the iPhone  It loads quickly and the interface looks great  Im hoping the next update supports groups	I like the concept of Friendfeed however  I dont check the site very often  *shrug* I primarily use it to tweet shared articles from google reader		
93425	one of the greatest concepts evr	hope it wont become a bluff		
73830	the best application ive ever seen !		
55171	Very useful tool both for computer and mobile use		
76093	Best alternative to Photoshop	Great interface  Great functionality		
36075	One day ALL communication will be in 140 or 160 character bites ; ) Like many social apps it can take a short time to get it!	Like we have a choice ; ) On OS X Safari looks great but historically security is sketchy  using Internet Explorer is asking to get hacked  Opera lacks addons		
8262	Like YouTube    but without the 12 year old girl lip syncing Justin Timberlake  Instead  think artists  film makers  and just plain cool people		
9594	the new feature supporting local content is wild	I love watching TED with this		
90391	  Simple chat nice		
76096	i got to say it is the best apps comparing to Skydrive  Love it!!	It is the best webmail i ever used  No doubt that it is easy to customize and user friendly  GUI is very easy to use even for those are not computer savvy		
60516	I need to learn more about it  I like it so far  and I think it has potential		
30772	been waiting for it all day  love it!		
30771	What about facebook updates? The desktop version does it		
30774	Best Twitter App ever  wished I had an iPhone so I could have TweetDeck everywhere I go!		
29791	lion catch bufffalo		
30773	One more reason to love my iPhone  Ive been using it for twenty minutes and its been great		
81441	I love the new software stack  and it feels more real worldly   finally a MS OS I can sink my teeth into!	Internet Explorer has come a long way and since MS continues to dominate the OS market  its something we need to keep in mind  Not such a necessary evil anymor		
29797	i like <a title=youtube izlesene video izle  videolar href=http://www youtubetc com/>youtube</a> very much		
59534	yeah man   this is good stuff  like eating a phillty steak sandwich mmmmmmmmm good		
68481	my friendship must forever		
30776	So far  not bad  I like the UI + functionality  Some hiccups though  Something backend unstable  Also annoyed @ req 4 superlong password  Whats up with that?		
42740	So far the best twitter app	Best music app ever		
92125	I have to find out  This is the first time I see it  So   still unclear www flamingoservicesbonaire colm		
41411	Dont know the reason but I love using this OS		
37397	Cant pass a day without checking it and sometimes spend hours		
37399	Its good for keeping up to date with close friends  Bad because you get bombarded by stupid applications and people you dont like		
36066	CS 3 ist perfect for designing websites but CS 4 sucks badly! The problem ist that CS 4 does not render the fonts like they will be shown in the browsers! FAIL!		
36065	Glitches with GCal oddly enough and other random bugs  Lacks extensions and bookmark syncing    still use it as default for overall speed  may switch to FF 3 5		
92121	oh my fecking god  best thing ever  i am truely addicted  :)		
42746	Aside from the Orwellian overtones and my inability to ignore the similarities between Google and The Borg  of course   I love Google		
55183	I think its funny that we are allowed 160 characters in this field instead of  140 like  twitter  allows : ) Im kidding  Love twitter!		
41416	When will be available on Facebook  or am I not up to date with this bit of news?		
49370	facebook is amazing and i love it sooo i have a question does anyone know a proxy site???		
30760	Created a group  could not add people  nor could I delete the group  Potential is there  not ready for release		
55187	Awesomeness  Could use a slicker UI though	Used to be my browser of choice  not anymore  On Chrome since it came out	I like orkut a tad better  if only because all my relatives & old friends are there	Couldnt imagine using another Webmail  Have been using it for five years now  still love it as much as I did when I started using it   if not more  Go Gmail!	The newest kid on the block  Rockstar		
30762	Love the UI  Very clever way to display multiple panels of content   Excellent work TD Team!		
1631	Great  Maybe Chrome is better but at the moment it doesnt offer me anything worth the hassle of getting used to soemthing new	Stats are great  I love em		
36069	A good social network unfortunately being abused for spam and irritating apps  Still one of the best ways to share any kind of media you like	Mozilla based  fast  functional with the best built in RSS reader Ive seen so far  Very well integrated social networking and media browsing	Browser of choice  Faster than ever  it is the best choice for those who like to use a tailor made browser  Abundance of add ons make sure its *your* browser	Incredibly powerful & useful social networking tool with minimal interface  Trending topics is one of the best ways online to be up to date with news worldwide	Although Im a Firefox user  I like to use Chrome a lot  It really is the fastest browser Ive seen  Its very lightweight and it never gets in your way	I wish they didnt do the native look for Windows  I used to use Safari specifically to escape Windows  and now it just looks like a native application  Shame		
48045	 a cool was to show case video		
30765	Hopelessly addicted  First thing I do in the morning  Its my newspaper!	I would love it if I could update facebook at the same time  I thought that was one of the features		
48041	Very fast  Easy interface  Still misses the plugins of FireFox  but a great browser!	Very good site  Lots of news about social media  High refresh rate		
30766	* Crashed twice * Told me I wasnt connect to internet  I was * Like the UI * Limits refreshes to 100/hr?! Likely wont hit that but if I do Id drop it		
94776	I LIKE IT ! ITS FUN TO HAVE ! :)		
8289	El mejor servicio de mails! por lejos		
16461	a ridiculous idea doing fine an a crazy world   i would prefer going out for a beer with my meat and bone friends but what to do?? by the way  i tweet too		
8287	Love it on the PS3! Only have 1 dvd out at a time but its totally worth it!		
15135	really useful application  i work for all my projects from any computer	i dont have the opportunity to have it but i really thing is very cool		
93449	cant not love it    useful    the forum software by the same company is also great: bbpress		
92117	The 10 50 works with most sites  but some of my bookmarklets stopped working		
2980	Their recommendation system is so useful and it runs very smoothly	Will be the perfect tool when people will start using it massively  But the concept is so good  Simple is everything		
29779	Greatesy invention since ADHD medication		
79140	Best music social network !		
36055	Great for new web discovery and good conversations		
36053	Very fast loadup/surfing times  is less of a RAM hog than Firefox		
61877	JESUSENERGYDRINK com  The Worlds Greatest Energy Drink COMING SOON    SPREAD THE WORD		
37380	probando www blippr com		
58229	I love GMail  So Fast and reliable  And much less clutter than Yahoo or Hotmail	Amazing browser  Stop using IE  IE so clunky and so  compare it to the speed and extensions of Firefox!		
1643	Wonderful service that is a great global communication platform  I use it daily	Great browser! Always my first choice  While 3 5 has fixed a lot of the memory leak issues  they still remain  Still a top notch browser	Good gaming platform that likely demonstrates the future of digital distribution gaming		
30751	Love the interface  Not very stable (crashed 4 time already)  More customization would be nice (bg color  refresh rate)  Good so far  wanting updates soon		
29773	FF iz so damn goooooood!! iloveit!		
48035	Fast and fast is what I want  Wish it could integrate with One Note		
82793	Like it sure  but its ugly and thats no small thing		
30759	Really digging new #Tweetdeck for iPhone/iPod touch  lots of features  Loving the layout		
30756	Its tiny a little hard to read  I first thought I could enlarge columns  Not bad though its useful to perhaps check all my groups quickly  Im mixed		
48030	Mashable is an integral part of my daily news feed	If speed is your thing   its mine   Chrome is the best		
30755	Looks cool and works ok  Crashed once already  not on App Store WiFi yet  Go to desktop Itunes @nonprofitadvice		
8297	Best way to find and discover new websites  Of any given kind  because you can  pretty much  modify it for your own liking	I always have Twitter on the go  when out and needs the Twitter world to know what Im doing  Rarely  but I can do it	Im trying this after TweetDeck and Twhirl is definitely better all around  Twhirls much more accesible than TweetDeck will ever get	How can anyone not love Wikipedia? It really is an endless source of knowledge to all things	Best way 2 keep up w/  and get the correct info out of  the famous peoples own mouths  without any gossiping sites twisting everything and get it all incorrect	I like it  though it does have an odd look	Whatd I do before I had my iPhone? No clue  because now an ordinary phone seems like nothing in comparison  I so love my iPhone and couldnt live without it	Those who founded this site  they are just the best  I just love this site		
73867	yeah  just when im learning how to do this		
96502	The best free email service and more arround!		
37376	It was great having copy and past

96503	Its the Clearest online Voice available all over the world	I am a proffessional and have got a job through it  Congs!	I use it to Market my campaigns and am earning lots of $$$$@http://bi		
8291	Web surfing bliss  Scads of add ons for nearly every purpose  Clean  organized and easy to use  Blows every other browser out of the water	Cleaner than MySpace  All of the options and services and such are a bit daunting  Learning the ins and outs is difficult  considering the help is lackluster		
58231	The more you tweet  the more you want to  Its additive		
73860	looks like twitter is experiencing another systemwide crash    thats a shame (		
36045	the fastest browser in the world!		
61884	Khub Bhalo(1st class)		
79176	Its so cool you can see other people form around the world  but there is so many hateful people being rude	Able to personalize it  has many options  and great add ons! Love it!	Useful and fast to look things up  but not always reliable	Useful  fun applications  and able to customize your profile! Love it		
1654	i think they have done a great job with the new version  hope they integrate @tweetphoto soon ;)	How could i not love it?

30749	Cant beat it  Works as advertised	Works great! Remember to restart your Iphone after installation		
30748	Way better than any free app  for some reason I thought there was an integrated facebook status feed  also having problem creating a tweetdeck username		
30745	Cant find it in my apps to download   tried tweetdeck and tweet deck   what am I doing wrong?		
61892	A bit beta  but I love it!

79166	Its all you want and its so easy to customize		
64925	So easy to use and so versatile  Theyre always making it better for us users  and the labs are cool to fiddle with  All Google apps work really well together

36039	I love`t man   !  Its good stuff   way interesting and i`m  sure everybody would find something they like in here  so its not like only for a certain individual		
81485	its been quite a while ive been using this with my clients and collegues  works like a charm for collaboration and communication / info sharing		
36037	Left both IE & Opera for Firefox  Never looked back since then  Chrome is fast but I will keep my loyalties with this bushy beast  add ons & all		
29751	I would like to give Google Wave a try  Can I get to try the Beta ??		
84512	it is good when it doesnt mess up		
60562	I like good friendship		
48012	It saves money from buying separate programs It does make it to easy not careful youll get to comfortable	Its perfect for what you use it for  Business or just your leisure  Its just a whole other world  Its my best marketing tool yet		
51611	very nice app   specially for add on	simple with amazing function		
30732	Def beats tweetie  The interface is clean and it syncs my groups with my tweetdeck on my computer   Love it   Def earns its spot on my iphone!		
30734	Definitely will compete with Tweetie  Not a Tweetdeck fan on my computer but may become a Tweetdeck fan on my iPhone  Crashed once so far  iPhone Hootsuite next		
13382	Stay social tuned !	Just the best way to create your CV online and get it on Google !

72551	Quite simply THE BEST	Lovely  easy to use  Great program	It truly is effortless  I have 3 tumblogs going effortlessly  =)	My favorite browser of the many I have  I collect browsers  and none of them hold a candle to Chrome	Twitter is a great system  not going to cheat it of that  But the simple fact is that I dont use it anymore  I actually deleted my account	I switched once to Bing  Another time to Ask com  Switched back soon after  Ask is okay  but its certainly no Google

40240	Its a little complicated but I like it		
67364	A great tool for any type of social networking!  Enter any URL and bit ly shrinks it down to a smaler URL   Great for Twitter or to refrain from FB clutter!	If you use torrents  and havent tried uTorrent  you are missing out   By far the best client out there!	A great tool for cleaning up your PC   I cleared over a gig with one use!  (Do NOT use on netbooks! It wiped mine out and I had to reimage it!)  Great for PCs!	Travel the world while in your pajamas!  Great satellite images combined with 3D models!	Tired of constant viruses and popups?  Ditch IE  and go with Firefox!  Better browsing  and safer surfing!	A brilliant platform for editing and creating images and media!  Tons of plugins/add ons  and great tools make it simple to use  yet in depth for masters!	A must bookmark site for those who are into social networking and news on all things electronic media	Netflix streaming ont he PS3 is great   but the selection of movies that you can watch instantly reads like pages from a B movie catalog   More new releases plz	Twitter is an amazing social network that allows you to express big ideas in small status updates

Stable  nice interface  enough options  lots of network support	Great core marketplace  always competitive prices  very wide selection   Other vendors are exposed here as well  so the selection is vast   Prime rocks	Firefox is a good  but not great web browser   What it has on every other application (presently) is ubiquitous extensibility: all kinds of add ins	Nice and light  integrated support for RSS   Weak regex syntax   No extensibility   Mine completely stopped working  so I migrated to Vuze and am much happier	One stop shop for RSS reading   Ability to like  to share  to post to other services  to comment  and to email RSS items  Unable to deal with secure RSS feeds	Gmail is great   A clean interface  integration with other google services  ability to pull email in from disparate sources  excellent search capability	Near ubiquitous social networking app   And *thats* the killer feature   has chat too  so thats nice   Can get spammy if you dont control alerts	Chrome is sweet   Its technically innovative  has a clean minimalist profile  and is beginning to implement Firefox like extensions		
59746	Use it every day! Didnt take long for me to upgrade  Connected to 4 computers already!!		
32621	I really love it   I use PS CS4 almost every day	I love Mac OS  i think much better then Windows

42896	Google is good but in its mobile version it formats EVERYTHING when i have a webkit browser even after trying to turn it off	Gmail totally changed the way i and many of my friends email  By far the best free email out there	Been using it since alpha stage amazing its really developed with plug ins and added functionality	really good way of displaying info and really like the 3d effects thou its fun not useful to me	Great free alternative to photoshop and its free but its much harder to learn and not very friendly	Great idea! but wish the site would be more mobile friendly and work on more browsers by displaying correctly		
92314	Gmail is the best organizes easiest to use email on the internet   High Storage space  great add ins  and more ideas coming all the time   Why use any other?	Nothing better than Google as search or as a Tech company	I am a heavy Android user and love its openness as opposed to certain other big tech companies	It is too convenient not to love  especially for Google addicts	I could use a bit more organization like Buzz	The best browser you can find   Fast  clean  dependable

92308	I like youtube because i had learnedfrom it

33948	I tkink that Posterous is perfect    I can to organize my schedule (times) and for publishing only I need one mail	It has all the information of my interests now about social media    and more	I love this aggregator  but I need time for concluding   it is very new for me    but now is amazing!	LinkedIn is a good site to store your professional data  but it has 70% of contacts  jobs and groups in USA    is one problem	It is marvelous    I like the aggregators	Nutshellmail is real useful    tout le temp!	I always think about Myspace how one site with wrongs about design  but I see some beautiful profiles and so    people prefer it    where is the fail?	I love it always    Twitter help me to contact people around the world for talk on any theme    it counts!	Twitter is god between the social media	I could say that I love it    but I use a few    so few    that I dont have enough words because the experience is minim    I think it required time  many time		
45116	Streamlining workflow   thats a big deal

871	I would make out with it and have its babies if there was a better selection   Till then  I will love it	It really lives up to the hype  I cant imagine ever going back to IE  So many options so   awesome	By far my most favoritest blogging site	So far so good  Very simple (in a good way)  Reminds me a bit of Tumblr (just a bit)	I have been using this app forever and am so glad it has expanded and flourished  There are so many ways to use it  I think of more everyday		
33132	Great blogging service  Easy to use and with good features	Very impressive  Great new features  make it a joy to use

34456	Ok  so who doesnt use Gmail?	I love this app  I just found it today  but I am already addicted  I can keep up with stuff I like easily tweet and keep on rolling	Who doesnt love twitter?	I really like flickr	Die MySpace Die!		
33126	While other map sites just sat there  Google took maps to the next level  Ill never forget the first time I saw Street View  Still amazing!	I cant imagine using another CMS for my site  Easy  flexible and beautiful  Perfect for us web designers	I dont know how I logged into websites before this program  Developers are constantly improving it too!	Quite possibly the best online disk service ever  Its so seamless I forget that its in the cloud  A must for iPhone users too!	Seeing the demo made my jaw drop  I love when Google innovates!	Pandora is what the Internet should be all about  giving each user exactly what they want	How could you not love being able to explore the world?	Hands down the most sexy Twitter client out there!	I only use iPhoto but it is a great photo organizer	Now I just need to convince my friends that a polished UI/UX is more important than being The Mayor of somewhere		
2159	I still remember when there were all those search engines  and someone recommended Google to me  Today  who uses anything else?	Overall  it is very good  better than IE  but ties up too much memory  Has its share of issues with Vista  both 32 and 64 bit		
86459	i like facebook directory	i love you torrent b`coz with the help of this we can download  videos movies and many more		
78837	so far so good   we just launched with wordpress and its been great	Really great information

30080	It is the coolest thing ever   brief but effective

10479	Twitter is where its at currently  When FB et al  intro new Tweet esque formats like they have  its a strong indicator of success  Search only strengthens it		
65550	A solid  but not particularly pretty web app for twitter users  Its column layout is definitely appreciable though	Definitely the dominant social networking site  but it seems that most of the time I spend there nowadays is spent pruning my news feed to block apps	A great looking alternative to google reader	A great  simple tool for data backup and portability	Quick and minimal  Chrome opens up a lot of space on my little laptop	Awesome feature  I use watch instantly as much as if not more than Netflix through mail	Neat idea  attractive execution		
66886	i found this new innovation of my life		
42054	this is the coolest site ever! lovin it!!!		
65556	great music site!		
30071	It would be great if there was a like option  I dont always like to Retweet or reply if I like a post I read		
30073	Great tool! I learned and communicated a ton with it		
30072	Twitter is a really great micro blogging site  They need to catch up to some of the 3rd party developers though  The Twitter homepage is almost obsolete		
33105	I just started using Twitter a few weeks ago and Im hooked  my emails are piling up  my website remains unfinished  maybe I should change the theme to Twitter!		
35767	http://piodalcin wordpress com/ my blog	twitter  makes the verb to tweet legitimate grammar		
35765	It makes it so easy to consolidate all the things I find interesting that I run across out there		
94093	Everything from fun clips  trailers  music videos and video game walkthroughs to serious debates  lectures and documentaries	Brilliant plugin for Firefox and Google Chrome! Takes your Google Reader feeds and displays them in a customizable  magazine like fashion	Downloaded the code from wordpress org a while ago and am currently building my personal website with a custom theme  love it!	I use it to subscribe to over 300 blogs  webcomics  news sites  what have you! Dont have time to read it all though	Not using it much currently  but its good for all sorts of things		
34433	haha can u really live without it??		
35764	Lemme check it out and Ill let you know!		
30074	I trust it more than I trust traditional media like newspapers  magazines etc		
77523	I love Gmail! As it is easy to use and also embedded with Many Google Apps at once which enables us to perform a lot while reading mails		
86479	Google always comes up with something new and interesting  And I agree  Google owns the world  Well  at least the digital world		
29093	its only getting better and better		
43380	Its become a part of daily life  Any site that can do that is win	Am mostly just in it for the forums  which are pretty solid		
14841	Awesome app  5 Stars!!!		
13511	great program :)		
85144	Love it still learning to use it	love it  It works great		
77526	Thank you god (Allah)for helping the creators of twitter brining it to us Its a great way to share your thoughts!!!!!!!!!!!!		
10486	Im loving it  To be fair  I havent checked out Plurk  But do I know people using Plurk? Much of the value is the network of users		
13514	Easy  fast and efficient ! Publish your CV online and find it in Google !		
56604	i luv it  its a whole lot of fun!		
13512	The best email service  e g  can you undo sent messages with other email services? well  with Gmail you can!!	A network that is worth your time		
29094	A great way to stay in the know re: what your loved ones are up to    also can be used to hone in on your interests  many experts on Twitter		
86472	i like it     i can find here some i need   tahnks Utube		
91850	llong time not used  but easy and reliable		
43373	its a good site to be look for it		
69921	Would have chosen love it which I did even have the premium  But there have been some glitches in the stream and artists like Dylan removed from catalog	Not perfect but as close as maters  To expensive for most users to justify the cost and recently to many superfluous features that dont work well	Useful for when the other parts of the web fail such as email major sites etc  keep up to date with stuff including tv shows	I have 7 Vista XP and Leopard running on my machines  Whilst 7 is better than Vista to say it is better than XP on stability is odd  still big driver glitches	I only wish they could get a higher reliability but for what it costs it is one of the best applications out there  Could be better but doesnt have to be	A very straight forward interface that requires only one key to use the J  Actually the keyboard short cuts are Google standard so easy to remember  Great!	Not as hot on it as I was a year ago  Took the premium due to the upload limit  but never used it  Pro lapsed wont be renewing it  Something needs sorting out	I have it but rarely use it  but it is handy for the odd occasion I need it  For the rest of the time I have a text editor or wordpad	Only gripe is it is getting way to big  partly because of ad ons which is why most of us love it  paradox  Chrome is much leaner and my first browser now	Not sure I will ever be able to fall in love with a social networking application  but Facebook is certainly the most popular  why? My space to messy?	Hard to fault it as a client this is near perfect extremely small foot print only wish other coders would learn from this	Only used it recently and so far so good  not perfect but hell what is  Looking forward to trying a little snow with it though		
90522	likes to talk to de brods		
69928	at the moment we cant use facebook in my country Vietnam		
30068	Twitter is a statistical sample of the worlds brain & thus how we think   dont be a geek on Twitter and say statistical sample; people wont like you! :)		
30067	Twitter is great!  I was to be a Twenius!		
52250	Just a sharp enough learning curve to keep out some idiots   But accessible enough for an idiot like me		
57943	so far its ohk it aint that bad i gess wat eva just get use 2 it lol		
30069	Its growth will bring eventual dilution of relevance  Will be around forever  but will someday be just that thing you used to do	Great example of good  relevant blogging		
30064	Best App For Torrent Dloading		
77554	Safari is the best browser!		
30063	My favourite Twitter app  makes my life easier and less chaotic :D	Twitters fab! It lets me connect to my friends  stay up to date on news and media that interest me and follow my favourite celebs  artists  authors & more!		
77556	Seamless integration with Mac OS X makes this the best sync solution out there	Really slick looking native Twitter app for the Mac	Anytime I dont think I like OS X  I think of Windows and shutter	Boring but functional interface  Loads of storage  but doesnt always play nice with clients because of its use of labels instead of folders	Took me a while to figure out what scrobbling is  but I like the idea	Useful backup for when Quicktime doesnt cut it on a mac  Doesnt have the same sort of integration  though		
34420	Hey Im Linux guy		
35751	makes the world feel smaller		
78887	best search engine		
30065	one day  Twitter will simply destroy the other blogposts		
76226	I Love Twitter com		
57949	muahhhhh sayang zaha		
78889	ahhh   kok gw yg kena marah cih		
10450	I like the idea of it how I can email  chat and tweet all in one window  but it feels 80% done and needs better privacy		
89534	Really like the integration with Google Reader  And since its Google  future APIs might actually work (as opposed to certain other social media APIs)		
11786	One of the best Search Engine	Any body can try it  effective feed reader	It works better with Iphones	Very cool photo sharing site	An awesome browser supports Mac	Very improved Book marking site	The best email app	Google is the best of the best search engine		
90518	Its one of the best social networking websites Ive ever seen  Its just awesome as the concept of social networking and its linking with email is awesome!!!!		
90517	Always love gmail	Twitter appears inestimable!		
10454	its great  except would like to add more columns & track conversations better like on Tweetie		
70902	New launch from Apps iphone games by mlab emantras com		
34427	Wow! Really cool

64246	i  want some one stong pastionet an can comprehind like desean or julio		
30051	I love twitter it keeps me updated on information that is important to me!		
97141	just really started		
26803	TONS of information here  its going to take me a long time to even read it all! Mashable is well designed and full of helpful content  A+!		
73195	Probably still lack a rework of the organization (youll have small informal messages with highly polished Waves all together)		
53594	I come across another blogger using internet explorer today Could not believe he was not on firefox  Its brilliant	Mashable is the best on the web  Everything in a nutshell		
34414	I have used firefox  no problems for like 100 years now		
34413	I love Firefox  Its my home browser		
29077	Its getting betterer and betterer all the time		
34412	Prefer this over Flickr any day :D gives a huge sense of community	Its constantly open  I use it every day  great for designing  art  doodling  and the new screen sharing tool is amazing	Simple  lightweight  super fast  Only thing it needs is Greasemonkey  built in  (i know theres a hack for it  but hey )	Chrome is better for me  but if you want reliability  compatibility  standards compliant  and highly customizable  Firefox is the best choice	Works great  Good for publicity for blogs  great for discovering new things  way easier than news sites		
35743	I also love it for its flexability to access my mail from anywhere and archive everything		
78872	Some think Google Buzz could be the next huge social platform	The best torrent app		
89529	i love it itz coolll		
78875	Skitch is great  It only sucks that the UI prevents me from saving an image that is higher than my screen  (The sharing tab is not available then )		
31383	Wordpress is the best CMS Ive ever used!	I love Digg! Its so easy to keep track of my favorite sites   without pissing around with my bookmarks! I also like finding new sites with Digg :D		
77544	yes it is good and useful		
76214	Plays every fucking thing		
30055	table legs monkey beak    i mean  i like it allot		
89527	Your turn to cook tonight? Need Ideas? We are here to help!! King Ranch Casserole  Revenge is a Dish Best    www localsarasota com/pages/Recipes		
31385	Much easier than Yahoo		
10462	Best Internet App Ever!!!		
85167	i like face book but i am not normally used it because in our university bond the facebook		
11792	dying to be a part of the upcoming trial	one of the best creative apps out there definitely a must have for me   each version offers better and better updates	great concept for storing/sharing/organizing/finding photos but they just dont do enough to try to continue to improve upon the user experience	free web mail doesnt get better than this	blippr hasnt gotten the recognition it deserves   as user reviews become more important and need for decent app directory grows blippr will flourish	a mainstay twitter app that keeps getting better and better  would love to see more multi user management tools like tasking  notes  etc	digging the copy/paste  but wish the hover bubble was more like hover arrows so you could determine exactly how many characters youre back tracking through	I did see a great post about things to add to the next release  but currently this is a phenomenal browser and I have no idea why youd use anything else	love the extensive sorting features of this very easy to use bookmarking app   one of yahoos best investments	this is one of the best Twitter crm/cms apps  but instead of coming up with an unecessary feature like ow ly they should consider more third party integration	ive been a fan since before my school was even allowed access to this digital dynasty that has become synonymous with all things social media	well designed   outdoes kaboodle	big fan   wish the ui was a little smoother	lifesaver   has all the flexibility of a simple google app	great idea   genius to partner with flickr but overall its speed is uber frustrating		
77548	Yes Twitterfon is very nice but I do prefer Tweetie 2	I host and post several blogs and it is so easy to use  coordinate and add on to		
91836	soo funny !! :)		
44692	Many  many  many features that are all crammed into one little screen  but slow	The best of blogging  updating  and short messaging	Addons distinguish Firefox from everything else  Even Opera and its crappy widgets that are so notoriously hard to update	Best storage  features  everything  Gmail FTW	Wikipedia is good  Wikipedias admins  satanic		
11794	the best twitter app for iphone   and ive tried pretty much all of them	great site for all things social media		
10463	Great interface  Great functionality	Lots of music  No more downloading		
11797	One of the most loved tools  I really do not mind paying for a professional account as it is really worth it		
10465	Its fast  simple and portable  The 140 character limit is both challenging and relieving  It doesnt take the time commitment of a blog post	Ultrafast and accurate syncing		
86496	deepak jha delhi		
34416	it is very good to use ubuntu  try it!		
29072	an effective and simple way to keep up with everyone without suffering through talking to them  :)	   i love Google Chrome more  but Opera is my second love!		
47713	too awsome to not mess with for hours		
69941	i love my parents and my friends		
91872	am addicted on this site cuz its so simple & cool at the same time		
6573	Excellent FOSS alternative web browser  Third party addons push it closer to perfection	An online portal to your social life  Serves no real purpose and results in an overall loss of productivity for humanity  but hey  at least its not myspace	Webmail that works  finally	A web browser that aggregates all your various social networking identities into one place for easy reference  Web 2 0 to the max	The perfect torrent client  All the bells and whistles you need  none of the ones you dont  Lightweight and stable		
9601	I love gmail and labs features!		
6575	an excellent music resource	great app for keeping all of my info in a central location	make your own station that you can teach		
90545	i love my space n u to tom		
82914	The easiest/best signup process I have ever seen		
10437	Great start  Still needs some work though	Once it grows up a little more  it will kick the crap outta iTunes		
11768	Perfect place to meet old and new friends! :)		
10439	Mashable makes me tingle		
30048	Pros: Currently a high active user base  convenient  connected to many apps  Cons: Hyped  over exaggerated  on its way down		
10438	i love it  but i really miss all the firefox add ons that simplify my life	i liked it more at first    i miss the simple interface & college only network (much more useful to find people in classes  etc)	I like it  but I like twitters format much better	its great for quick facts    not so great for academic research		
77576	Wordpress will become a most powerful and popular CMS in future  Its easy but Powerful  So  I love it		
56630	I like twitter and I want to looking some friends!!!!!!!!!		
31375	I love this operating system! Linux is:   open source!   fast   reliable   amazingly flexible   well documented   great for web servers  desktops  etc		
90538	Once I had the time to configure groups to post to  it will be great to be able to filter to them:  its a much better version than that on Facebook		
11761	Now you can broadcast Live video and post pics to IRLConnect com and it shows up at your geo location  super cool!		
10430	So far Im using it a lot    looking forward to seeing where it goes		
11764	Nice work IRL!		
30049	Love it except    Twitter itself is limited and no other application (Tweetdeck  PeopleBrowsr  Flock  etc ) does it all  Still waiting for that killer Tweet app		
34407	I like Linux  but it will be a LONG time before it becomes consumer usable    if ever		
11766	Firefox is thousands miles ahead of IE  Its my favourite browser		
47702	i love everysong come on		
6581	A great start for this site  I can see Blippr really become a helpful source for reviews with a larger user base  I also would like to see more blip types		
42015	whatsup my name is keesha about me cute nice		
65595	Well  Google is Just Amazing   or I can say Google is a Unique way to use internet  No one can beat Big G !

68629	hey people waz up?		
23750	Amazing micro blogging app!!!		
69959	Its fun to put your city (in my case  Indianapolis) on the map with Gowalla!!!		
82908	Very fast  love the simplistic interface and finally for mac too!	Nice integration with other social networks		
10447	With TweetDeck on both the desktop & iPhone it is hands down the most effective client for accessing Twitter	Posting a tweet is like eating Lays Potato Chips  you cant tweet just once :)	The definitive professional social network  Still the trusted place to make your business connections	Mashables is a must read! The Wall Street Journal for Social Media and Web 2 0	No I have not used Google Wave  but my expectation is high :)	Best geo social networks and a great way to stay in touch with friends	The successor to Mosaic  freed by Netscape with inspiration from ESR  Maintain balance in the browser wars against IE  Thank you deeply  with Love!	Simple & seamless way to keep important files available  Between several desktops at work  a number of computers at home  and now the iPhone  Its a keeper!	Amazing! Installed  signed on to my account and my list of contacts pops up  Call my biz partner working in India  W00t!	The reference for email clients  but it is becoming a bit outdated with integrations features in Digsby and Gmail		
35723	I think it is great! I wish I knew my way around better though  Thank U : )		
52283	Quite better than loads others  Not be the best  though		
30037	Pretty good for TV  lacks movie selections		
32694	this is cool but fairly new to me	its ok so far i just have to get used too it!		
32695	Twitter RoCkS!!!***$$$ Because i love 2 meet new people		
30033	I use it every day! Groups are the best way to keep track of who youre following		
90527	i love my wife neetah b		
10442	I like it  but I dont like the latest versions as much  It just seems like a long summary now rather than collage	Whether youre looking to see what new social apps you arent on yet  or find a username that is universally yours  namecheck is the place to go!		
14801	no more twitter web @loray14 get up on this since ur tweetdeck wont work		
88211	Fast  easy and perhaps dangerous in the near future    who knows		
89542	Regular searches done automatically and sent to me  Love it!		
91859	i like it but i join it like 5 hours ago		
75728	I can connect with family and friends I very rarely get to see		
75727	Como el SMS pero mundial  gratuito y con seguidores  Listas  filtros  hashtags  Una red social de por vida		
9620	digg is the shit   period	its alright I guess    nothing to jump for joy about		
48108	Twitter enabled me to connect with people much faster than ever before  Ive met a ton of awesome people & Ive received new business as a result		
38781	not so much right now  have hopes for it  It has potential		
38782	The best business networking tool to come to the net so far (Twitter may steal that title!)	I like it   all my Twitter accounts + facebook in onw place  Similar 2 twitterdeck  but no video

Chrome just cant convince me  I guess its mainly the plugins that do it for me		
69093	i luv it babes!!! nyc wrk luv!!! loveyhoo xXx		
61132	youtube is mindblowing you can have all what you want keep it up UT

I might not have 09 yet  but iLife was one of the main reasons I bought my mac in the first place	Remarkably simple concept  very easy to use  and its free!	iTunes is nice   But I personally prefer Songbird	Worked well  until my network caught me for illegal downloading   Ah well	Ill never have or need another email account as long as I live!  Gmail is simply the best email service	Its the worlds leading search engine for a reason	Everything about Songbird is perfect   I feel sorry for iTunes and its lack of customization	Very quality app thats great for people that like to tweet breaking news throughout the day!  I definitely recommend it!	Evernote is awesome   Anytime I want to make a list of things I use Evernote and then I can take that list anywhere!	Ive been using Wordpress since November 2nd 2006   Its a great service but with Twitter and the micro blogging craze I think its a little out dated	Using safari on a Mac is browsing perfection	I have nothing bad to say about  this automatically means that its awesome	A filesaving system that works flawlessly	I liked it before the update   I think the whole background and notes just look weird now	Grooveshark is the best!  Im listening right now!	This is the best idea for a website Ive seen since Twitter	Twitter is the best site ever without a doubt   I have never enjoyed a website so much   Join Twitter and youll find out what all the buzz is about  =D	Works amazingly any time you have internet access but no tv (OFFICE!)

2294	The idea of Twitter isnt revolutionary  but it seems to inspire incredible ideas for ways to use the service  It provides news  friends  and services  Amazing!	For me Gmail isnt a webmail client; it IS email  Other email clients are inferior for a number of reasons  primarily *threaded conversations*

13639	Good app  reliable and iPhone styled but fundamentally flawed   it needs to be open to receive a call  Tut!	A bit messy in the design  but without doubt  the best place to store pics on the web! + iPhoto syncage = Ace	Best Twitter iPhone app going !	I couldnt go without my iPhoto   where else is comprehensive enough to store all my pics?!

92397	Despite the fact that mac fan boys have trouble compensating for their lack of directx and smaller software catalog  windows remains superior	Windows Vista was not  as most think  a bad OS  Released too early  perhaps  but the negative opinions are mostly driven by users with under spec hardware

29975	Actually created account after seeing it Blippd and very pleased with the site  One of most easiest and aesthetically pleasing blog services around!	Awesome HD  but I feel kinda hesitant about uploading my normal candid videos because all the others are so creative and intense	Its nearly impossible to explain logically what exactly Twitter is  but the sites simplicity is what puts it leaps and bounds ahead of other social mediums	Very pretty and fits right into the aesthetic look Mac has going  Had TweetDeck and twhirl  but Tweetie wins hands down for being the most simple and efficient		
78096	this is my favorite browser  it runs on all of my computers  and i absolutely love it  its a great web browser that works with all the sites i go to	i tried all the popular webmail providers  gmail is the best by FAR  one of my favorite tech  :)  yahoo  aol  and windows live dont even come close	goddamn amazing! best cms for blogging there is  simply the best  i installed this on several servers for several people	bings a joke  google saving queries a few months longer is utterly insignificant; no impact on my experience  better search results  and best webmail too!	its not exactly so fast at  everything  necessarily  other browsers are faster in other ways  i prefer firefox  but i have chrome too  and like it  FirefoxFTW!	its definitely neat  if you want to check it out  personally i dont have it installed on my computers though
