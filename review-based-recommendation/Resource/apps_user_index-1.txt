60902	stable  good mix of features  and practically everything can plug into it   long live firefox!	Great service  data mining is a bit of a privacy issue		
34622	Its learning capabilities for auto completion are great!		
34620	i havnt special think		
29267	Super fast  super secure browser with great user interface	I dont have much of a need to tweet myself  but I do follow a bunch of cool people	A bit too bloated  but hands down best web developer tool (with Firebug  Dev Toolbar  HTML Validator  etc )	Industry standard  Superb piece of software engineering	I like the idea and your implementation  I would love the site to be a bit faster (use Ajax more )	Really nice torrent client		
78208	Big and powerful app   but still easy enough for standard editors  Just get in touch deeper for some installations	turn key solution   ; ) what else do you want?		
3632	Even better now theyve got shut of those daft dots in their name  Trying to remember where they went when typing the name out was a right pain in the arse	well    er    an email app    yeah it does what it says on the tin  it delivers emails into my inbox  10/10 for that  isnt technology wonderful	very good site BUT sinking slowly  lots of accounts being banned for copyright violations  could be the beginning of the end for youtube	Google a big global corporation so are therefore evil by default however their service  well it cant be beaten	Recently discovered this web app & very interesting it is too  Some nice stats  Though I feel the novelty may wear off after a bit  EDIT: Good discovery tool	the single most useful app ever  its secret? you can customise it to your hearts content & make it your own	I like the idea of blogging but cant be arsed to take the time to post stuff  Which is why Tumblr suits me down to the ground  Nice & easy  click click done	Excellent service to catalogue & categorise your book collection	Its nearly 4 yrs since I played Travian & I still shudder at the way it controlled my life  I hated it & loved it  it took my life over  thank god I broke free	A one stop shop for movie & TV information  The best of its kind	I dont have a 12secs a/c but love the idea behind it  However I dont like that vlips are public I would only want to share with family	If you wanna know how to create a workstation from an old crate  a wire coathanger & some sticky back plastic then Lifehacker is the site for you	Very useful if youve got some time to kill & want to visit random websites  click  click away to your hearts content  Causes insomnia  Just one more stumble!	Recently discovered Virb & must say Im very impressed  Its very classy  Its like a posh souped up Tumblr	Ambivalent  Neither like nor dislike  Does what it says on the tin  Easy to use	the first web service i ever used & despite the invasive ads theres something i like about yahoo  cant quite put my finger on it but yeah yahoo!	Where movies go head to head & you decide which is best  Their ranking system then lists your favourite films of all time depending on how you voted  Addictive	My preferred image hosting site  But that may be because Im too lazy to find an alternative  Has some seriously annoying ads though  the sort that flash & buzz	blippr is a great service  even better now apps have been added  everyone should give it a go	Listal is IMO the best social cataloguing & collection manager site on the web  Very easy to add stuff to your collections & then sort & arrange  Check it out	Nice  very nice  Get movie (and TV) recommendations on titles  moods  plots  actors & keywords  More I think for US users due to Netflix integration  Shame

23978	Only search engine I use  and Im off Map Quest and loyal to Google Maps  I feel like its more user friendly	I cant decide if I like this or not    it seems like one  giant  ongoing instant message	Keeps you in the know when it comes to social media!	Way better than Map Quest!		
42234	the image search is better than google	Just trying out Blippr and loving it!!!	duh  the only way to share vids online as far as Im concerned		
42236	Nothing like being at work and being able to log onto any site whose pw you have saved on your home computer

1	Im a recent convert  and Ive been really happy with it  I used to just listen to Shoutcast radio  Last fm is that  except better in all the right ways	Ive settled on it as my preferred Twitter client  Works great; my biggest gripe is that its built on AIR  and tends to be resource heavy  Great featureset tho	1st Jabber client I used  and good enough at what it does  but I dont have a use for it over other multi protocol IM clients  Good app  but not for me anymore	Everything I want from a torrent client  and nothing I dont  Not much to say beyond that!	Mostly useless  but when its useful  its really useful  Collaborative design seems to be its niche	Great little plugin  The external player management is what I first used it for  but providing a inline flash player for any in page MP3s makes it a winner	A bit of a memory hog at times  but its good enough that I use it as my primary  Does just about everything I want in an email client  and not much else	Absolutely wonderful  Great content  high res videos  and ads that are short enough to be worth sitting through	I use WinSCP as my general purpose FTP/SCP client now  but before that  FileZilla was my choice  Great if you just need FTP	High octane geek oriented social news filtering  No nonsense UI  great amounts of content  and more customizable than competing offerings  Love it	Really great combination of several products  Has some stability and performance problems preventing love it from me  but those will hopefully get worked out	Im seriously impressed  I tried the RC on a whim  and have been very pleased in most every way	Hard to beat  IEs a relic of a bygone age by now  but Opera  Safari  and Chrome dont match its customizability via plugins  Im a definite fan	This + my XBox 360 completely satisfies my TV entertainment needs  Dont have cable anymore  and dont miss it	Great extension  Im really  really digging the multiple rows of tabs  since I tend to have something like 30 open at any given time	Ill ashamedly admit to never really using finance software before Mint  but Mint made it easy and useful enough that I have no excuse not to	More useful than I thought it would be  Its not digital crack for me like it is for others  but its certainly changed interactions with my social circle	Convenience is king  Ive bought more games through Steam than Ive ever bought in a store  and the weekly sales are a huge plus		
10667	much more people use this searchbox	This is one of the best think on the online solution		
76495	Great Twitter client app  with tons of functionality   Anything you need to do on Twitter   The only way to go if you have an iPhone		
29276	i think dat itz awesome		
2	Google has crushed me yet again with their Tsunami of Awesomeness!	A wonderful video site that is a far superior user experience than YouTube  And their commercials rock  too	I have a love/hate relationship with Facebook  I really do love the utility it provides  but hate that it demands so much of my time  Curse you  Zuckerberg!	The easiest blogging app around  inclusive of some killer aesthetic features and layout options  Bravo	I havent gone there but a few times  but I cant do anything but give the design a solid love it!	Its beautiful  plain and simple	The anti YouTube if you will  Vimeo is a wonderful example of creativity on the web	Fast  I havent made the switch from FF3 quite yet  but it may someday come  Only time will tell	The mother that birthed a new web generation  Oh yeah  it has nice pictures  too	A nice application for the friend collectors of the world	Inspiration for blippr  What more need I say?	If you want the most robust blogging platform  this is it  I prefer Tumblr for simplicitys sake  but I think Wordpress is incredible	Simple and effective  And the provider of vlips (video blips)  too!	IE trembles in its wake  As it should	Its a great idea  and good execution  If only it worked all the time	A great spot for local information  even if a little distracting from the core focus at times	I dont use it all the time  but its a really nice app when I do	Now that they offer DRM free music  theyre all the better  Im not as much a music lover as a film geek  but I do appreciate iTunes while I work	A quality service with just the right plug in for my favorite blogging platform  Tumblr	Really slick and simple  If only you could say that about most apps	Great Digg alternative  cleaner  simpler	The next big thing? Im not sure  but it does a good job fulfilling its purpose	Okay  so Im biased  But truly  I do love blippr  first as a user  then as a founder  I know we have much more to do  but I like where were heading	I dont add videos  but I sure do enjoy watching them	Simply the best  Now if Google only made a desktop client that beat Outlook	Discovery made simple  O the things Ive stumbled upon since!	The most useful guide to navigate the Social Media landscape  period  (Full disclosure: theyre our parents  so Im biased )	I love when I have it plugged in  But when I dont  I hate it saying I need to update  Argh!	Their most recent redesign is cherry	I dont use it for my regular news  but I do use it as a way to find *some* entertainment news  And typically its good	A dead simple app with the perfect features  A must buy for all iPhone using  Twitter loving geeks	If only I had more time in the day to enjoy this service to the fullest	It gets the job done  but it isnt nearly as good as Picasa  Flickr  or other services I prefer	A very useful FF plug in for the tweeting inclined		
3	Cmon you dont need me to say anything about Firefox   Use it  Love it  abandon Internet Explorer for all things except updates	By far the most user friendly and flexible email service I have found   Far better than MSN/Yahoo/Any other free email service		
96095	Mega useful when sharing full res photos and videos with mates and you dont want to use Flickr or Facebook		
4	Great way to get news fast	Personally I dont use YouTube to post videos  but I love watching what other people have posted on there	Check it almost everyday and I love how easy it is to find people you havent connected with in years	I can listen to songs that I havent heard in a long time  NO COMMERCIALS either!	Great way to stay in touch with friends throughout the day	I really like the fact that Gmail doesnt erase your emails after so many days and youre able to look up past IM conversations  Even better  its FREE!		
35940	The best just after Firefox !	The best social website !		
5	The best  most recently accurate source of information on the planet  It should totally be a legitimate source on scholarly research =P	Anyone who is still using Internet Explorer needs to be educated	Fantastic site  just what every creative mind that uses computer programs needs  My one complaint is that I dont have my own software to record something!	So freaking cool! Download a copy and go explore your planet  Be sure to check out the topography  too  Mount Everest is really hard to find  though	Good to find out about movies you like  but not a very user friendly interface  Id like it more if the layout was more shiney	Like all the useful things Ive come across  Steam was introduced to me by my brother  Useful for hopelessly addicted TF2 gamers		
6	Its fun and I trust my friends opinions more than reviewers		
79528	the best  myspace sucks because it is too slow  but facebook combines status with email with photosharing with fun in the perfect way

35947	A great place to dump my ideas quickly while they are still in my mind  Slightly inconvenient to access later		
88473	I would follow Google to the ends of the earth! Ok not really  but they did pull me away from Outlook as well as a lot of my time spent with Office (GDocs baby!

34601	Love it  Best place for all my social media news  Its all I need!	Its my primary blogging platform		
10634	Thoroughly enjoyable  but can easily eat away the hours of your day if you give in to it	does everything one could need  Only downside is its use of XHTML which is inappropriate for the vast majority of Web users out there (the ones using IE)		
60932	I love it I stay on it the whole time Im online  You dont have to use the web and have a tab open to keep up with Tweets	I have been using Internet Explorer since 1998 and for some reason I downloaded Firefox I am moving all my bookmarks to Firefox its so much better and faster		
81875	I could honestly say that facebook is a perfectly good networking creation  it has many features of you being able to occupy time  and meet and greet everyone!		
29243	flock really improved over the last years  meanwhile its really fun to use! but there are still some issues to be worked out		
79555	Love this data backup/transfer service   2 free gigs?!  YES PLZ!	The best blogging platform!  Makes uploading cool finds quick and dead simple   Love it	Amazing photo gallery service!  Lots of features for free  but everyone should totally upgrade to pro (like I should ^_^)	Instapaper is an amazing read it later service  especially with the iPhone app!  Ive been getting so much more reading done because of it	Only started using the bookmarking service  but all the social networking integration looks nice   And the chrome extension is great!	Love reviewing all the social media updates!  Perfect journaling app  cant wait for future improvements	Love the stability and speed   All it was lacking is Greasemonkey support  but Greasemetal seems to do the trick!

92548	Nice service to bring rss feeds together	Good ideas like working together with wolfram alpha  But Google has just more know how	I tested every browser very deeply  But Chrome was the best one  Fast  bookmark sync with Google account  Faster access to Google services like Gmail  Youtube	free  many features  Go on like this!	Great functionality with all these plugins  But the other browser are faster	Free  Powerful command line (bash)  You can edit it like you want ;)	Really great idea to rate the web ;) But reviews without any comment should be allow  But only allowed  the commend function shouldnt be abandonned in any case	many useful infos  Always up to date  Linked with any service (blippr  facebook connect   )	Best video sharing platform  But too slow  I cannot watch a video without waiting during watching it	Best Linux OS  Really like it ;)	Most things work  But other browser have better functionality	compact service  Good API  I like things like retweet  following without any confirmation  lists	Best social service!	Its nice to get all your actions in the web bundled  But its bought by facebook  And facebook added the features to import the messages  too	Best client for tweeting  facebooking and get all infos from these services  But they have still to do many things	free service with much functionality  Missing features like importing mails from your computer (e g  Outlook)	Best twitter client for iPhone	Nothing to say  Dont know how to improve  Fast

46665	Twitter is a terrific platform to express ones altruism   In a context that overly accentuates the commercial

89756	Interesting folks/people are met through this media		
12411	Dont know why people even bother with other webmail programs	Keeps me up to speed on social media sites and business activity	Favorite browser   Fast  clean  flexible	The spice must flow!		
5436	Its recommendations arent brilliant  but its a great way to find people with similar music tastes to yours	More space and better features than its competitors and  at the moment  the only Webmail service you can access offline  I wouldnt use anything else	I was surprised to see that Alexa ranks Yahoo! above Google  Mail  Answers  and Flickr are great  but Yahoo! Search sucks compared to Google	Feature filled  and the only software I would dream of using for organising my music and syncing my iPod  Sadly  its rapid growth has made it slightly slow	The new version should make blippr a real contender in the social networking market  Tell your friends: lets make blippr the next big thing!	Congratulations! Your iPod touch is now an iPhone Wi Fi  Its very easy to set up your profile if you dont already have one  and audio quality seems very good	Such a simple site  but potentially a really useful one  Its great being able to find people with similar interests  and its easy to add yourself to the list	The fact YouTube is the biggest online video site is its greatest strength and biggest weakness  Theres some great stuff to watch  but it gets swamped by crap	If youve only ever used Internet Explorer  you dont know what youre missing  Firefox makes Web browsing easier  more secure  and ultimately more enjoyable	I used to use uTorrent  but then I found Transmission which is a cleaner  simpler  more customisable alternative  Also regularly updated  so its very reliable	Thought Id try it now theyve finally de uglied it  seeing as Tweetsville has been all but abandoned  Great app  I love replying straight from the timeline	It finally arrived! New Challenge and Two Player modes are awesome  150+ free tracks to download  The new look is great  too  Tapulous continues to amaze me	I visit occasionally but I dont enjoy it as much as Digg  Reddit is too open and instant  Digg relies too much on the algorithm  Theres still no happy medium	I think its a shame so many people are moving to Facebook  MySpace beats the pants off it in terms of usability and customisability	Now YouTube supports HD videos and downloading  Vimeo has lost its unique selling points  Uploading is much faster and simpler  though	Unlike most people  I didnt have a single problem with Vista for the entire time I used it  I prefer Mac OS X  but Vista is still a nice OS to use	Its a solid operating system and proves Linux doesnt have to be complicated  If I ever get another PC  Ill be running Ubuntu on it for sure	This is a really useful app  Ive been using Shazam for years on my phone  In the UK  you can dial 2580 and Shazam will text you the tag	Lemmings meets Dizzy Bee  This is an absolute joy to play  and you can either sink hours into it or play for a little while at a time	Definitely a powerful tool for bloggers and Web designers alike  but be prepared for one heck of a learning curve if you want to make your own themes	I just set up a drop for the website Im working on  drop io is really easy to use and customise; and it even updates live  Great stuff	I liked it so much I paid the Â£12 for a license without ever seeing an advert  The UI is stunning  and showing @replies and DMs as threads is a great idea	I used Paint Shop Pro for years  but with newer versions it got slower and slower  Photoshop does the opposite  and its far more powerful to boot	As youd expect from Apple  iWork is simpler than Office but just as powerful  Being able to export in DOC and PDF formats makes iWork a viable replacement	I used to use this to make all new window links open in new tabs  but its included in Firefox now  Was useful back in the day  though	Mac OS X isnt as perfect as everyone likes to make out  but its the best OS Ive used so far  Now Ive gone Mac  Im not going back	Occasional inaccuracies  but its not as bad as people like to make out  Dont use it for anything too important  but its great for quickly looking things up	Its Last fm for software  Tracking works well  but recommendations need to be more intelligent (e g   I obviously dont need Hotmail if Im using Gmail)	Interface is clunky and non native  but the service has pretty much all the music you could ever need & the playlist sharing works well  Adverts are infrequent	I dont have an aerial socket in my room  so I use Zattoo a lot  Streaming is generally very stable and quality is decent  New channels are added regularly		
5437	My 2nd choice  :) However  great help when comes to maintain ratios when download through private tracker	Quite better than Vista  Somehow user friendly compared to Vista  The UI also changed more to classy and elegance look  Love the bootscreen & welcome screen	The best music streaming service  Fast  slick & less cluttered design  Very user friendly  Wide variety of collections	Sharing files became easier with Dropbox especially when comes to huge files  Easy to setup  friendly user  awesome upload speed & download speed	The best one stop center for latest news compared to other social networks		
55503	Chrome user since day 1 and I love it		
37711	Digsby is awesome! Its got everything I need in 1 little app!   <a href=http://www codeshout com/tracking202/redirect/dl php?t202id=1607>Download it now!</a>

4108	Yelp has expanded my gustatory horizons   What an awesome example of crowdsourcing and leveraging social media   Nom	some bugs but it looks good so far   Faster than TwitterFon	I pretty much use this app solely when Im not on my iPhone		
37713	Havent had any app I like better than Twitter (!!)		
88420	Important data & life timeline repository   shame if the account mysteriously got deleted though		
55508	like captain kirk on the flight deck!	enjoy the tech   bethehurricane needs to get some more diggs! workin on it!		
46656	Best blogging platform  hands down  A fun community  a fun app  My favorite platform and social network		
9810	Great service! Love the site and all its doing to help their users		
6784	Easy way to keep in touch with friends and with people that I am interested in  Can update my Twitter from my phone  which is a huge plus  and it is easy to use	Video  price  and image search a good  but Google still gives the best results when looking for regular websites		
42295	i like youu tube		
9809	the BEST   and only one I know of where you can put in a SONG not just an artist		
88418	Used it for over 20 months now  Its by far the easiest way to share files		
55511	Cant go back to firefox after using chrome  I love it :)

4114	Luv this browser!!  It has its own news reader and cant beat for social intergration	I like to use to track news events in real time from people that are there   Havent really gotten the hang of the social side of it yet though	Keeps my computer sparkling clean!

9805	I havent been subscribed to Mashable! long  but so far I really like it	GREAT video site  Wish there was more content though	How can anyone not love Tumblr?

32019	Best Twitter app yet! I like that its web based and remembers all your settings  so you can use it on any computer	Its pretty good  Used to use it but using Hootsuite now		
12424	A great Adobe AIR application for all those twitter wh*res out there!		
64472	its good and runs faster than all the other browsers but IE8 wins on its user friendly interface  Plus the new Msn toolbar seals the deal with windows live		
5460	Well built and extensible  Big improvement from version 2	A bit cpu hungry at the moment  Will improve	quick and easy  if you dont follow may people :)	well done  Also a good backend to build apps on top of it	The best way to collect  find and share my bookmarks	Bestest solution ever to synch folders on different machines	I like the way to can browse life streams	essential  just (and exactly) what you need		
5461	It has become a little bloated over the years  but as a developer and power user  nothing beats it (once you tweak it with add ons) DEATH TO MSIE!!!	Ive recently made the switch and it does everything I used Windows for  a few things better  I wouldnt yet recommend any *nix OS to casual users though	The price is steep  but it must be worth it; with so many commercial and free alternatives  and after Ive switched to Linux  I still use it in a Windows VM		
45316	the best way to contact people around globe		
9821	Twitters amorphism makes it nearly anything you want it to be  Simple yet complex  like all the best things

52490	Mashable understands that its not just about the existence of new technology/social networks  but the use of them thats cool		
96064	Ireally like it  so much  ms		
35999	good but it should take care of the space it consumes on hard disk	First day on it and feeling good about it  Technically a very good make   Loved idea of textbox background fill as you type in About You box in profiles	one of the best reader available online   very slick with interface and fast	They create some amazing stuff    gMail and gMail labs are the best examples of it   They pushed Microsoft to innovate and see now they are innovating :)	The best web mail service around  Forget everything else   go for it	Its all about sharing knowledge for me   Whenever need some quick tips/steps just visit it and almost all times you will get something related	Good   great    best    Now I dont need to manage so many IM clients    Surely recommended	I like its UI  but still firefox rocks	Ok   i love firefox   but 60% of my clients and their users still use IE (6)  So I have to love it    Dirty business :)		
13728	Perfect Job network	Cant complain about it  Love the add ons	its just so easy to set up a blog withWordpress  Thumbs up	I like the idea  But will see how itll work	the best search engine so far	Great way to share info

87119	i <3 google! especially on my android and now google chrome! its the best		
33332	Twitter keeps me in the loop and gives me the public opinion on news  reviews  tech  music  and politics  Its a one stop shop		
33331	i try to avoid advertising at all times   but since it is my choice to engage &perhaps win something   i will cooperate! @moontweet #moonfruit?	it is essential to democracy by allowing the world to witness things online that they would find abhorrent in real life   and to protest those things		
51167	keeps things simple and succinct  not as addictive or distracting as other social mediums		
76469	Yahoo have come a long way in the past year or so  I expect to see big improvements from their services in 2010! Far superior to Google	Still (imo) the best browser out there : )

29288	Has been quite fun until now  lets see if it lasts		
30287	gmail really useful	nothing to say   good and few bad		
29287	This fledging marketing subsector isnt difinitive and therefore is scattered without Mashable and the likes

Dont know how we did without it	Useful  simple  open  Love it	Even my parents can use it  :)	Wish more developers were making games for it  Could be amazing  Still need boot camp for now though	Kind of a toy  Doesnt do much more than Google Maps  Could be clearer how to overlay information	Could do with slimming down  The best browser for customization		
8505	With only two main options available to communicate with friends online  Facebook makes the task at hand effortless  Myspace was the past  switch to Facebook!	Its a reliable  compact client that I can count on for my torrent needs  I did not notice any excessive memory usage as I did with many other applications	It plays a lot of repeated songs  but its excellent when I dont have my own music with me on hand	Looking back at my first email sent with Gmail in August 2004  I cant imagine going back to anything else  Truly an addicting app  good job Google!

Choose wisely! :)

8545	A must add to your RSS reader	I really love it  Just try it out	Its good but Im getting a Mac soon	Mashable is THE BEST social networking website	An OK browser but Firefox and Chrome are better	Really awesome  Its as good as BlogTV	Defiantly the BEST blogging platform  EVER	GREAT! Perfect for Twitter users because you write reviews in 160 letters or less  (just like how Twitter uses 140 or less)	I really love Friendfeed  Its growing on me	Really good app  But Im not a big Skype person	I use TweetDeck as my main twitter client  But  the only problem is that it uses a lot of API requests (Which is pretty much refreshing Twitter)	Its Great  Twitter Search is coming close though	I simple and good idea kepted simple (which supriseingly dosent happen often)  I really like TinyChat!

You just cant understand it until you use it	Indispensable  although the UI feels a little clunky for some reason	I cant wait  Apart from anything else  kill the subject line! This really is the future of email	Best interface for Flash video  but the T&C scare me slightly

11049	Can imagine life without it anymore		
37679	I dont expect to have to pay someday for all my great Google tools  They are not Microsoft  They are funded by their carefully placed ads  Good for G and me		
36348	Just started my blog here a few days ago  I like the interface and the whole user experience	Love Ubuntu  I have used Ubuntu since 5 04  It is very easy to perform administrative tasks on  The beauty of Ubuntu though is its community	Looking forward to using this app  on my G1  I just signed up for an invitation today	Good but I have to tweak it massively on my eeepc 701  I use it on my desktop  still deciding between Tweetdeck and Seesmic for dominance on my pc

35006	Great service to discover new websites  One big downside: You can not share your favorites easily		
86635	I truly tried to use Wave  but the problem is that I  just like many others  do not really get the idea behind it   GOOGLE  needs to further develop it		
37664	Best RSS reader available  even superior to any desktop application that attempts the same thing	Fast  renders webpages great  Too bad its so unstable on Linux	More space than I would ever need  fast  works great  and has great add ons as well	Always fast  even though its funded by donations  Great source of info	Underrated  Great mobile OS  and open source too

1948	Not a bad blog for the socialsphere of the internet	I dont use it much for storing photos  but for finding good photos  it is a gem  However  the search isnt great	For what it is  I think it is the best of its kind  I personally dont like these types of things though	tons of space  great clean interface  I prefer this over software mail now!	It is really hard to find anything decent on it  the lack of real programming also hurts it  Can still be fun  but just difficult to find it	I have to admit  this is a really nice tool for twitter  though most useful if you follow too many people and twit too much	Easily the best overall browser  no longer king of speed  but the extensions are still what make the difference over Chrome	Has a lot of potential  but needs add ins at the very least  even then it is just getting close to Firefox	I love it  thinking of getting a text plan just so I can twit on the go	I think Google has started to lose traction as a search in the last couple of years  but it is still consistently good	It is still a good resource but the interface seems to get worse with time		
85321	I mainly use it for the stats  and I fucking love stats  Stats  man! Its also pretty great to find and keep track of events	Clean UI and great extensability  Publishing and organising is a lot of fun  Pro account is cheap and worth it  Free account is very limited

61384	i love some one    i need he for life		
74699	Fast became an essential way to keep in touch with my friends  plus play some fun games  But I trust Zuckerberg about as far as I could throw this planet	Simply the definition of speed when browsing the web  still needs some work on the extension API like it needs the ability to stop elements from loading at all	Firefox enables the web  exactly how you want it  An extension for almost anything  I just wish they would work on making XULRunner a bit less of a memory hog	An incredible idea but still a long way from people understanding its true potential I feel  perhaps when the APIs are more fleshed out	Without google you would have to find your way around the web with the likes of Yahoo & MSN  I wouldnt bother going online if that was the case	Almost overnight became an absolutely essential communication and news tool  hope they find a revenue model soon	Simple and blindingly fast that takes full advantage of the hardware I give it  Exactly what an OS should be	A superbly simple way to keep yourself up to date on all your sites news and articles  the best reader I have ever used	It was a superb idea while it lasted but since the CBS buyout development has ground to a halt and I dont see the service being around much longer	Simple fast with stunning uptime  gmail is the definition of a system that just works

59068	tell people twitter and they listen even MPs Its Awesome!!		
53763	Great wish I could get on my iPhone  damn apple I have loved them for years but now they have grown more into pop culture they now have a big ego for problem		
37632	After over a month Im still using the free version of Twitterfon  Its quick and stable  does everything I need  and the ads arent intrusive  Why pay more?	Never used the previous versions  but 3 0 does more than I ever though a phone could do  With th right apps  the features like the compass become essential		
11003	The best OS right now in the world	The only issue is they write too many articles a day  which it makes a RSS no so attractive		
77736	it just works! they do have awful user agreements if you happen to have read them  but who doesnt?! let us hope they will never be abused

Awesome concept  well implemented  :)	The best online bookmarking site around	Great site for web 2 0 media  news  reviews  beta information and much more	Like it   definitely has room to grow  and needs to in some areas  Potential to rival Twitter  but not yet	A good starting point for researching a topic    But as its all user submitted  a fallible resource	Cant really say anything about youtube that hasnt already been said  It rocks    Just dont like the muting theyve been doing to some vids  :/	Probably the best desktop twitter app	I wanted to choose dislike    but almost everyone I know is on there  and I cant change that  So Ive learned to like it  lol	I love Virb  but I cant get anyone to abandon Facebook for it :/	Definitely excited about google wave :)	This is definitely a good twitter app  though there are a few bugs here & there with the 12 seconds recording etc   Highly recommended all in all	Essential if you use Firefox	Such a great browser    I flick between this and Flock at the moment    but thats only due to the lack of extension support  :/	Very very handy   love the feature where you double click the desktop to hide all your icons  :)	Like the more social aspect of the site  but people stopped interacting so I left for twitter	Its a great idea  but not enough people seem to use it  :/	One of the best wordpress comment plugins out there    Tops disqus in my opinion	I dont see why everyone hates Vista so much  Ive been using it for ages  and its almost identical to XP  but with a few tweaks  Roll on Windows 7 though  ;)	The best social music site at the moment	Probably the best multi protocol IM client Ive used  Clean  easy to use  and a low memory footprint	Started using this over Twitterfon  and I love it  Awesome application   a must hve for iPhone twitter users

74770	Quick and simple   how social media should be	twitter is only OK in my eyes  Its the API that makes it better than it is	I prefer Posterous (the email function wins it) but Tumblr comes a close second	YouTube is by far my fave site  How did I ever live without it??

6025	addictive and ultimately somewhat pointless way of sharing life	Gradually improving but works needs to be done  Make it so that you can blip ANYTHING   literally		
15531	Google Voice Rocks!  Bringing convenience  flexibility  and control to our often chaotic and overwhelming tangle of communication systems and devices		
8689	Needed to warm up to  but couldnt live w/o it now	It seemed like it was destined to fail when it was first announced  but its the best place to watch top quality shows		
11175	I use it for more than 2 years now and its quite good  much better than other free webmails in Poland		
72123	I think there is some real potential replacing e mail  But they need backwards compatibility and a standard for others to base on		
73453	www Blip fm/mellejohnson is my station and is easy to use as Twitter and great if you have your own content to promote  Plus the founders are very open		
64504	Twitter is fantastic for building an online network and sharing items of interest  It pushes social networks beyond the exclusivity and personal nature of FB		
74781	Interestingly enough  I see people pulling there phones out to tweet and sending phone calls directly to voice mail  Times certainly have changed yet again!		
8681	Just testing out this social rating thing  Works nicely  not sure if Ill use it much		
28847	Where you can catch raw talent  motivation  up and coming  already famous folks at this is the place to go	more words than twitter and just as good

53850	Love the new integration for e mail  VoIP  chat and at the apps  This is missing in the boring facebook inbox		
44074	Seriously? The innovation of the web at its best	Better than Iphone  not as good as windows mobile  (Im talking in terms of customizability without hacks)	Its good  but im not a big twitter person    not any of my friends use it	Well     Not as good as Firefox or Chrome  but better than safari and IE	fine for blogging  but i dont blog that much	Blippr was a stroke of genius    Thank you Mashable!	Blippr is better  cus it has everything	Lightroom for Post Production all the way!!!	Wikipedia  you look up something simple  get diverted by a link in it     hours later you ask yourself  What was I looking up again? I LOVE YOU WIKIPEDIA!	Loved it  that is til mom made me delete it	Good for finding local restraunts!	Windows media player begone!	LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!! (except for lack of UI customizability  and other hacks [which i LOVE to do] So for me  WM and Android are better  cus of XDA DEVELOPERS!!!!)	Awesome for finding stuff   Howd you find that game? Oh  I just happened to Stumbleupon it!	For chat only though  adium and digsby are better	Much better than all of the competitors out there	One thing  PLEASE MAKE YOUR LOGO BETTER!!!!  I love the pic of the day   And microsoft doesnt $uck  Theyre richer than u would be if you lived a million years	Its good  not as good as windows 7  not even close	Its good    Not enough people I know use it    Then it would be a love!	FREE TRACKS YAY!	Ok  so you just blipped the dang thing itself    How can you NOT give the I Love It! You cant even blip it without IT        Weirdos	blippr is better  but this is automated	Expensive but has the most awesome feature set EVER!	Fine for random facts	If only tumblr had it built in *sigh*	A great add on  kudos	Except for the fact im not really a weight watcher	Its a good idea  just a bit poorly executed    If they integrated it into the facebook status or twitter  then itd be a love	Flickr  where to start    Much more social than google images  but sometimes has less relevant results   This is better for a laugh or personal pictures	YAY!! I CAN SEE MY HOUSE FROM HERE!	YAY no switching windows!	Though just a mod of Firefox  I dont like it    just get firefox and stuff	Nice    Still think Office is better   This is about the same price	For twitter  it is the top  but unfortunately  as in my many other reviews  im not a big twitter person	Just add Addons and    WOW!! This would be I more than love it  it would be I     IDK  its completely awesome	Again  twitter is really not my thing	Iphone version beats any gps	YAY!!! USERSCRIPTS GALORE!	While good  it doesnt not compare to acrobat com and zoho	Never was into feeds untill I tried this   It keeps me interested during spare time and during work  like my own personal magazine!	Naaa  Meebo is better	Good to remember stuff    not altogether that functionable tho	Search  docs  Chrome  Android  Maps  earth     Awesome	This is awesome    spotlight but 1000000% better	I think that xmarks has better built in functionality	I love it    Except for the fact that the other people who use it see someone using windows    USE UBUNTU  ITS BETTER lol    I dont like that	Ok    ive said this enough    If you want to know what i mean  look at my previous stuff about twitter	Its ok  but blogging isnt really my thing	In terms of straight up tv show watching  it beats youtube by a long shot	But im not an adult  so I dont have to worry about finances :D	GREEN BIRDY!! YOU ROCK! If only you spread your wings and allowed for email and social networking like my beloved Digsby	I like Easy Cleaner a little bit better	Yep    Googles genius shines again    fast mail  themes  plugins  the firefox of email!	But for collaboration  Acrobat com is better  and for easy filesharing with multiple access there are much better options out there		
8679	FriendFeed is the greatest thing on Earth!		
11178	Twitter completes me :)		
36459	Good one   but soon its gonna be Snow Leopard!		
8695	I am glad Twitter has really taken off  I find myself spending more and more time on it	Mashable has been a great source of info  I am glad Leo had him on TWIT	Cool site  I think it could turn into a great resource if enough people contribute	Still getting used to the new design but have really enjoyed reconnecting with old friends	I think Google Voice has a lot of potential  For a free beta  it certainly exceeded all my expectations		
45	Unlimited storage  no deleting  super easy searching of everything ever sent or received  plus a good chat tool and other extras  Gmail rocks my socks	Does anyone even use that Other Browser anymore? I love the plugins  switching between tabs by keyboard shortcut  and I love that it saves my tabs when I exit!	Its fun  super easy to use  and a little bit addicting  sort of like how Facebook is a little bit addicting	Kinda sad  I hardly even scan the actual news for headlines anymore since my friends status updates keep me in the loop  Its a great way to stay connected		
61481	Cant live without it! (very geek lol)	To be in touch with friends all over the world!		
8694	Is definitely a Twitter client that Ive been waiting for  but agree that its not for the casual Twitter users  See my detailed review http://tr im/td4iphone	Indispensable tool to keep me up to date on what my friends are up to  especially those overseas	the easiest way to broadcast my thoughts that are too short for a blog post	Its as Apple had described but more  Although the missing features found only in iPhone 3G S has convinced me to upgrade http://tr im/oDB5	I think this is the best Twitter client the supports multiple accounts and has a Group feature		
61482	I Love blip it so cool		
73469	I BROWSED FIRE FOX ND ITS DA BEST		
65840	Before or after the news feed update?

74730	Great desktop  mobile or web access to your files   This has been a huge winner for me	I like Shelfari  have been a user for over a year and love the improvements they have made over time   An iPhone app would easily make this review a Love It		
95673	Great online video browser with social aspect  Videos from various sources  gives good recommendations and an addictive user interface  Share videos on Facebook		
40521	The most versatile blog and website platform out on the web today   You can just about set up any kind of site you want		
40528	I tried other desktop clients but tweetdecks help & streams made tweeting much more enjoyable		
9164	Good  clean interface  now mostly free of bugs   I have used it for years	very good as an IMAP client  coloured tags are cool		
35172	It has brilliant security  Ive only gotten things called Trojans  but I dont think those are viruses  so theyre probably helping my system  :) IE ftw		
9163	Its fast and my default browser  but I use it with Firefox    there are some extensions I really like there   Also Chrome seriously needs bookmark all tabs		
3858	use it quite alot with my graphic designer		
23183	Runs perfect on my Hp Mini 1000   Infact its faster than any linux distro  or other windows OS Ive tried on it   Indeed much more stable than Vista   Perfect	For how lightweight it is  it runs much better than any other torrent client Ive tried   Runs in the background without affecting performance at all		
28873	Im still get the use of it!! But its very simple  and I like it! I recommend!	I just love it  its very handful and you dont even have to bother yourself about anything  it is just what it is! S

39537	Simple to use and more features then most sites I have used till today		
14234	Still givin it a test drive	Only hearing good stuff   time to dive in tweet first

32903	Totally agree with you  @istambulhotels

60108	Hi5 has new improvements that make it awesome! I like it!	A bit slow with homescreen swipes and app startups but it is truly a wonderful phone OS	I use plurk everyday! You can hook it up to Twitter  Facebook  Yahoo!  and more!	All the apps are soooooo addicting! FarmVille etc    And almost everyone is on it so you can hook up and talk with your friends!	I love how you can login to other sites with this singal account! Im using the login with Twitter on Blippr now!	The ability to set themes is great!		
26222	neat and clean and simple also small and free	exactly what it says  Internet Movie Database	so many addons how can u not love it   a browser as u want it to be	i used to love it but now it feels to cluttered with so many new features and partnerships  like meebo and rotten tomatoes	neat   clean   free   small   portable also available   easy   also notifies about mail	has a whole package  u know g life	all in one note management  i use the portable free version   it wont minimize to taskbar but the installed one does

39529	Twitter Application with maximum features; simple

78446	I can use the Google translator! Awesome!	Im still exploring blippr  There are various of application here		
54478	Needs work  other services like vimeo are much more superior  But youtube works	Playlisting need help    other than that nothing is wrong  There is a reason vlc is the only media player I ever use		
33531	Its not as good as bloglines organization wise  BUT the interface is lovely  and it has tagging!	Pandora was the original music discovery thing  and its still on a roll	I love stumbleupon! Its the ultimate boredom cure for a rainy day   when youve read every book in the house  (:

1218	A great place to share your photos and get tips from those you meet  It is easy to discover truly incredible images and photographers and interact with them	Gmail changed the way I use e mail and I would struggle to go back now  Innovations such as conversations and labeling make e mail a quick and simple process	The more you use it the better it gets  Programs such as scrobblers help make the process of finding or being recommended new music nice and simple	I must admit that I was a fan of Vista once the kinks had been worked out of it but Windows 7 is a step up  Fast and easy to use with some great little touches	In my opinion this is easily the best BitTorrent client currently available  Simple and clean  just the way I want my torrenting to be  Highly recommended	A powerful and creative image editor and creator  There really are no limits to what you can achieve with it  especially after learning how to use it fully		
46834	but i keep having problems loggin in  i have reported this and no one has got back to me  i have reported this problem several times over the last 3 days

79766	love is very important but with careful  also like to be loved		
53158	Actually Im indifferent  Prolly best & my #1 choice of clients  Im still surprised people still use the P2P network  Newsgroups R really the way to go	Just recently started using Opera  and have become a big fan  Anything with open development is always a good thing  in my opinion  Web 5 0 is their hi point	Great if not greatest micro blogging media hub  Always the latest trending & of debate  10 out of 10 from me	A must have for those of us that enjoy and want to easily share content to our favorite social media hubs  a 10/10 from me	I somewhat like Pandora radio  but I was referred here from Avatar Pandora  lol	Its becoming more and more of a source of quick up to the minute information hub  It really is a social network hub  but is also more		
87389	Im still committed to it  Theres lots of potential left  Maybe marry it to Buzz?		
3888	The best browser on the net atm  It still needs proper script support & addons might be an interesting addition but it cant be beaten for speed and simplicity	Brilliant  I found LOTS of new music with this   I just wished it worked outside of the US again  : (	Im undecided on the best social media site for us book fans but this is certainly in the top 3	The best of its type  just fix that annoying jumping up and down upon liking items on FriendFeed please!	Lots of information here  perhaps could do with a lick of paint here and there  : )	OK but Disqus is the king at the moment	Even though theyve started removing music videos from the UK on YT its still the video site I go to first	Looks a good alternative to WMP and iTunes	My weblog service of choice   I love the latest version  the plugins available and how easy and customisable it is	Pretty useful Twitter directory	I used to use this all the time but its one of the services Ive discarded like Delicious  still very good though	Use this to play DVDs  very simple and useful	I need to try this more but it seems pretty useful	One of the best sites on the Internet   Great community  superb features that are being added to and updated all the time and very addictive   Love it!!	Nice app/service but not used it much	Well ya kinda need it nowadays  ; )	Easily the best photo sharing site out there   Love its community type features   I upload mainly to here	Certainly better than IE (love lots of the plugins and its features) I prefer Google Chrome for its speed and simplicity	Well they have lots of cool stuff  the search site  the browser  etc	Not perfect but its support for so many services wins it for me	A must have for Firefox users  though I use Chrome now  ; )	I only speak for the music site: I like a lot   I check the featured artists each week and regular search for music or new artists	Pretty cool but I couldnt get into it   Im keeping an eye on it though  : )	I dont really use its unique features but might do once it swaps to Google Chrome from Firefox	Potentially a very useful and interesting service   Looking forward to the upcoming WP plugin which Ill definitely add to my site	Potentially very useful   A good service already could be great once this new all in one comments service (seen on Mashable) is released	Good site  but discarded it as I use too many such services   If there was a way to submit to it when I bookmark/like on other services then great  but alas	Good  just wished scripts worked properly (or at all in the alpha/2 0 version) in Google Chrome	Good site  well theyve bought this site so gotta say I like them  ; )	Excellent new service from Kosmix  personalising your newspaper is dead simple and it looks very neat too   Very customisable	I rarely use it now  too busy on FriendFeed and Twitter but its an OK service   I can catch up with my real life friends with FB	Love it  I swapped to Gmail permanently a year or 2 ago   Now only use Outlook to download a backup of my mail	I wish this was far more popular than it is   I prefer this over Twitter but everyone uses Twitter  simple as that   The responded tab is cool	This is potentially very useful   If the bookmarklet was tweaked I think I would use it regularly so will keep an eye on this service	Nice and simple but its Digsby for me for its integration of all the services I use   If those services in Gtalk then Id swap  : )	Excellent site  a regular read for me	Excellent service  love the scrobbler  love that thesixtyone works with it   Get good recommendations   Not as good as Pandora  but cant use Pandora now	Love it  yeah there might be the odd mistake here and there but its the reference site of choice for me   The design is great!	Excellent  the premium photo editing app   But Adobe need to drop the ridiculous price tag on the new version though  no way am I upgrading! : (	Pretty good user friendly version of Photoshop	Twitter is my FriendFeed messaging sidekick  ; )	Great to have an online version of Word  be it a basic alternative		
86084	finally just got the blackberry app and so far so good   its a lot of fun!		
69503	hmmmm   so far so gud		
66477	Your opinion of this app in 160 characters ohttp://www blippr com/home/edit/servicesr less

74099	now days i am unable to log in properly as well as attachment of certain files  This has been experienced in the recent past Any technical problems please		
53161	Sounds great!  Looking forward to a new communication venue!  Sindy		
83805	Twitter is more for functionality than social networking  in my opinion		
83811	cool  style able		
10877	It has the best design of all time  No other website even comes close to it in terms of freshness and simplicity		
79794	Twitter the Town Cryer of our generation  Love it!		
49091	Kool way to stay connected with your professional colleagues		
78468	So far  its great  That said  I havent had to do a restore  But you can map the cloud space as a drive  so direct file access shouldnt be a problem

10884	I get some interesting ideas from it! Thanx!		
28161	To heck with MTV  I want my Google Wave!!!!!!	Its very sociable  I like Twit Army as well  its Twitter only more directed to a particular group of people with the same interest!  COMPUTERS!!!!	Google has it GOING ON In the morning when I get on the net  its like Christmas when I see a new GOOGLE App		
10883	heyy! thats G R E AT :)		
33504	I found blippr through StumbleUpon! Not recommended for the procrastinator!		
92784	How could you not love the power of Photoshop   awesome program!	The best thing for international calls  As Long as you dont mind wearing a headset :)	I use this to update and review all of the my tweets   has worked well for me so far	Use it everyday   normally it works perfectly  but sometimes it can be having a bad day and take forever to load	Drop Box is really excellent online sharing and collaboration tool   works perfectly with our Apple Macs	It has to be one of my favorite applications ever  Its having a real impact on our social media   We love it!	Perfect choice for us   Firefox everytime	Still getting to grips with how I can use it to its full potential to expand my business network online		
91458	Finally  intelligent two way social communication		
90127	Not quite ready for prime time  but with time it will be compelling		
46809	Great to find new interesting or funny photos  but you dont get much space unless you pay $25/year	Good  but the ads are very repetitive		
58871	Twitter Is The Opium Of The Masses		
2592	Finding it useful  but messy		
37093	Really The God Father of Streaming Videos		
57545	i love facebook cause its hot		
34821	I love this wonderful application  only need net social functions to be totally perfect		
10859	Friendfeed is the greatest social media tool  Its community is really cool		
57541	hahahahaha cool as lol (:		
56213	i like to fly with my girl  but no girl friend		
70504	I think its great     but could do with more intergration from google chat     Would be nice to be able to use it in a desktop app rather than on the browser		
66491	its cool to know what everybody is doing  Your friends  family and even celebs!	nice site  useful reviews but not working very good in IE8 (so i need to turn on compatibility view)

65175	i like it but its a little TOO OPEN   i need a little privacy   why should all my friends see what all my other friends are saying to me	i love google   they are a very unique company   they are capable of doing anything and have the resources and money to do it  they are the modern day microsoft		
68202	yea its good i like facebook		
70521	It works  Hate the cones though		
69535	I lurve it    as long as it can show me what i want to see from this website   heehehhe		
29473	Hard to get the full benefit on wordpress com  suspect hosting myself is the way to unleash the power within	Skype and Facebook chat worked easy peasy on my N82  whats not to like?		
31785	Just started using this  Great access to music  but navigating the site is difficult	Best browser out so far		
29479	results should be more graphical  and more organized  not just a plain listing		
77148	 Another time  i shall give to you my opinion on it  after to have taken a little moment to see it very well  Okay  bye and next time !		
10861	Great program to manipulate photos and other pictures	Great time waster  Good way to discover different parts of the web	Plurk is simple and fun to use as a microblogging site  No API gives it a lower rating from me though	Awesome program  just needs identi ca and friendfeed for me to fully embrace it	I think this is the only way to read RSS feeds  The best web based reader	Facebook is ok  Too many apps out there for my taste	Tumblr is a great way to share snippets of the web with little to no commentary  Simple and easy to update	Friendfeed is easy to use and improving all the time	Microblogging  Thats all I have to say	Ubuntu is my linux system  I run it on two computers	Good  but not as good as it could be    especially after requiring people from other countries to pay to use their radio service	Gwibber is a microblogging app that updates twitter  identica  jaiku and the like with your status updates  Runs on Linux only	Gmail is the only email I need		
50922	Great app  makes me want a smartphone		
70517	Just fine  The app on blackberry needs to be improved		
49063	i love facebook x :)

10829	Newcomer to last fm  but instantly hooked		
57562	I think blippr is cool!!!!!!!!!		
77174	Very convenient way of summarising your background acting as a virtual resume	They say that knowledge is power therefore sharing knowledge is a means of empowering others and increasing common understanding  which makes a better world		
90141	I think google buzz will be better once people on google buzz talk about more than google buzz and whether google buzz is better than twitter or facebook		
90140	I havent seen a TON of difference between this and twitter other than you can post longer sentences and your profile is more accessible to strangers		
56238	the only think that might could be better is wave :p		
29444	An easy interface for reviewing stuff  Custom tweet format would be nice		
83852	I love it  but i would love even more  if Google would buy it  so i could use my 80GB Google Storage		
50930	My favorite email service	Its fun  App invitations get annoying though		
5634	The environment really cool & eye appeal   Users even can upload clip in HD format Best place for creative mind	Google never need to be explained why its an excellent search engine	Haha  its not monkey at all but its  very helpful buddie with javascript thinggy Im using it for download Apple movie trailers easy as pie	The entire file sharing is easy even newbie also could use it I get extra space every time invite my friends Lack of pain neck features is major note	Decent fast & pretty cool data transfer at a time Throw your portable devices if you dont like or hate this coolest data transfer app Youll lose easiness	Who dont like to browse web with smooth & speed? Opera is my 2nd choice after FF   Excellent Fast & Clear  Absolutely brilliant choice	Its just easy as pie install the add on on Firefox synchronize the bookmarks & use in any computer via portable way Finally able to backup my bookies	Communicate in a professional way & can get the world wide open	Its very very basic and simple app & its really recommend for twitter newbies No pain neck settings nor features to choose on Yeah its only add on what  hmm	Im simply LOVE this app its a fantastic way to connect with buddies & at the same time can spread the word in single update Kudos to the founders   !!!	Whats more better in online activities if not share the link & bookmarks in a single room	Same UI like Tweetdeck but I still prefer Seesmic for its better management system Kinda easy	Simple clean & cool Friendly UI and exactly my 2nd choice after FF	Unlimited titles & topics to find out  Real feed for information seekers Youll never dry out information	Manage the desktop icons by put in one place & invisible way to clears the clutter Its pretty clean	Its a HUGE WORLD for videos You just name it  IT will play it	It makes the browsing session extremely cool & exciting	I like the wordpress theme & the surrounding for its classy clean & eye appeal outlook which completely deviate from normal blog	Come on man  Its cool windows that Im using right now  since 98	Cool to share multimedia contents reviews opinions & views in a single platform	Its really good idea but Im always scared with the over expose features which can make criminals to get information easily Seriously consider this  !!!	At least you get something to share with your friends for idle talk	It makes things much more easier with just get know your updates in a single predecessor  without have to sign up every time to open an app

47244	Great video sharing tool	Very useful tool for voip and video chat  Unfortunately it charges you to call landlines	A pretty cool service  Good use of AJAX    IF I COULD USE IT  Google Maps refuses to work on Firefox 3 0 13 for Ubuntu and Google Earth wont work either	Way better than Windows  It allows me to actually FIX the problem instead of restarting and hoping the problem magically gets fixed	Great for playing weird formats  It unfortunately doesnt have a library to organize my media in so I use Rhythmbox for the most part instead	Definitely the best email service  It supports POP/IMAP and lets you use it for FREE (unlike Yahoo) and doesnt throw ads all over your messages	Now that theres a release for Linux I love it  Its way less of a RAM hog than Firefox (on Linux at least) All it needs is a Solaris release and and more addons	I love Blippr because it doesnt allow people to ramble on about how much they hate or love something  Plus my attention span is short	I love this  It suggests great music for me all the time and I dont even have to go to the website  I can see it all in Rhythmbox music player	I like its attempt to integrate all sorts of web tools into one app  The problem is its slow for me and the IRC part of it sucks  Ill stick to FF for now  :)	Gets the job done perfectly  And I dont even need to pay for it	It compiles basic knowledge of a subject that people know into an article  Also very convenient for information and definitely underrated	Ubuntu 9 04 is the best OS Ive ever used so far  Although I did hate it when 8 04 was the latest release  Never tried 8 10 though  I was using SUSE at the time	I like how it shows information in the bottom frame about the song youre listening to  The embedded browser might have been overkill but otherwise very nice	I like how easy it is to figure out  I was able to figure it out within 10 mins  Im still trying to figure out squarespace and I only get 14 days free with it	Way better than ASP	Definitely the best social networking site  Plus all my friends are using it  Its very organized and a great way to see what my friends are up to every day	Everything Ive seen Google come out with is done amazingly  Except for Google Pages  I didnt like the organization of that	Im not a photographer and I dont really upload pictures but a lot of the other pictures that people upload can be pretty cool	I use it for all my email accounts and RSS feeds

Wikis and the global information sharing environment is an essential part of who we are and of our history and arts	Its versatile  easy to use & implement  it has embedded applications that will project it well into the future and more importantly  it outstrips IE totally	Blippr  Vimeo  Veoh  and other media sites all rolled into one which in part  was Googles overall design mechanism is doing very well indeed

10966	fascinating bits of lives		
29578	yeah    love twitter  best place to view everyones thoughts  :)		
82632	One of the best things to ever happen to the web  The greatest enhancement to web searching since web searching was introduced  Google is the web search king	Hands down  Google Maps beat MapQuest at its own game  Fast  smart  powerful  and backed by Google  What else could you ask for?	Fairly addicting  simple to use  and its turning into a very nice service  More connections and better ways to find things to review are my top requests	Nothing amazing  but its a decent idea in todays fast moving Internet driven world  although it is used for entirely the wrong purpose much of the time	It re invigorated the browser wars and gave IE a well deserved run for its money  Truly a superior browsing experience	Amazing mobile OS  period  The devs at Google have done something truly special with Android and I can no longer see it being anything other than my #1 choice	Ridiculously lightweight and simple to get going  Also sports the fastest negotiation and download speeds Ive ever achieved with BitTorrent  The best	IE is the heavyweight; Firefox is a superior  lightweight alternative; Chrome is a reinvention of browsing simplicity  Like all things Google  it just works	Linked in is very powerful for professionals  though its not always easy or obvious how to use it to its fullest potential  Needs an overhaul  but recommended!	Fun to configure  simple to customize and install plugins  very open and non restrictive  and it seems to naturally look professional  A wonderful blogging tool	Destined for greatness (I hope)  No need to carve a new niche  just do it better than Twitter  and the user base is already there	imeem was a truly outstanding service until it was gobbled up and utterly destroyed by MySpace last December  Thanks a lot  MySpace	A good alternative to the overly bloated and frantic MySpace  and it offers far more features and tools than Twitter  But those apps and games are so annoying!		
49165	Its perfect for keeping daily touch with inner and outer circles		
507	A beautiful interface  compelling features (both useful and fun)  well organized data  The best in the social geolocation space

43054	The is the coolest place to get your photos on the web  You can see my photos at www flickr com/photos/13ideas	Tweetie does what I need it to do  URL shortening and Twitpic support is great and you cant beat the killer interface	Twitter is addictive  fun  and friendly to connect with people you know and people you dont  The only problem I have is spam   get rid of auto DMers!	Twitter  Facebook  and more combined on one page  Love it!	I use the best Twitter client for my computer (Tweetie for Mac)  so I have to have the same for my iPod  Really simple app that has all of the features you need	Must read for social media addicts  Ive found some of the best web content from reading Mashable	Best place for web video hands down  Youll find some of the best content on the web on YouTube

8810	Ive been trying to use Ubuntu more to start learning Linux   Ubuntu is easy to use and I have been really liking it and have had almost no problems	VLC is a nice media player that plays anything right out of the box   This is pretty much all I use now since I dont have to worry about finding codecs	Gmail is great   A simple  online email service that works   It has made email so much more useful to me   The threaded view makes it so easy to follow replies	Ive been using Chrome for a few months now and its pretty good   The only thing its missing is extensions   More privacy and security controls would be good		
36760	This is a great idea! No need to read very long reviews! Its all here in 140 characters or less!	This is a really great twitter app  It has a nice design  Although sometimes it gets kind of crowded in my opinion  Its also as good as the desktop version	This site keeps you updated everything social media  I discovered Blippr because of this

76772	just need separate pages		
88759	hey this is faith purdy and jayla hughes was up homiesjay		
10143	Very convenient to bookmark at work and at home  Beats keeping a log of favorite sites to share with others eventually	Need to take information with grain of salt  but overall a fine example of what can be done with a social app bounded mainly by a level of self governance		
87423	I would like to see this specific OS progress and evolve to be the MS Windows of the Mobile OS world!	Love Linux but it will never be mainstream because there is no one version that developers can write apps for!		
87424	Its amazing  I can check my mails (from other accounts as well)  I can chat & now I can even Gweet (Buzz)  Can we say it Gwitter Book  ? www DezinoGraphist com		
11473	=D I love this site  what value it has!  They could easily be charging a monthly fee for what they offer!

36754	Only gripe I have is that I cant provide direct links to files in my idisk public folder  this would be a great feature for various forms of social media		
11478	Finally found a site to digest what it is and where it is going   I can now make intelligent choices and make events work for me  not the mystical or		
8817	We live in a Google called Earth	So far  so good  Simpler and more useful than this  only Twitter	All the web into one single station  But its not as fast as it was before!		
8818	Gmail is the best e mail application there is  I always found Hotmail and Yahoo mail to be ugly and old fashioned  but then Gmail came along  Fabulous	It may be a little slower than a couple of other browsers  but its major advantage is all the plug ins  The best out there and miles better than IE		
11479	ustream is a  huge service: free live broadcast on the web with chat  Twitter  polls and linked subtitles  Excelent! ;)	Seems like a good way to improve blog visits! ;)		
3144	paid the premium membership   which is praise enough (Im tight)	not addicted  but its good   getting sticky enough to stop fickle users moving on	cant beat it   no need for a PC based client any more	left pandora for it (3 yrs ago)   wont be going back	loads quicker than firefox   seems to make my computer freeze after about 6hrs of solid use   still  worth it for the UX

54530	Google Reader has made my internet use grow with 50%  Now I have all my favorite sites and blogs new right in one place  I love it!		
15807	Firefox itself is great  Easy to organise and transport bookmarks  Tabs are fab  Some of the add ons arent great but you cant blame Firefox for that I guess		
32388	I think Twitter is great  I joined simply to see what the fuss was about and didnt expect much  but now I use twitter more often any other web service		
32389	WOOOO go linux!!!! I have recently converted to it and i love the freedom!	IT IS SO AWESOME! search a topic and you got your self a RSS feed! Go google! in fact Im using it now! :D	This is going to crush hotmail!

536	Its just firefox    with all the plugins one needs    it rocks the web	Flickr is the best photo sharing service with the best community !	Blippr made some cool changes lately  I am an early adopter too  would be good if they have bog ratings and better profiles	I have been Twitter user since its very first days  when it was just a side project of Odeo in 2006 Now I really like it well I do miss the free sms capabilitie	Its a cool idea   even if so far I haven`t really seen it in actions  Also its confusing / is it free or not ?		
10110	Greatest thing since sliced bread!	Great place to find info on anything	Ill love it when it gets extensions    but will it still be speedy?		
36740	i like to share on facebook		
79838	Their search algorithms keep developers accountable so they have to build real sites with real content  PPC limits mean the rich dont rule the web  G rocks!		
8822	Fast  Really Fast!  But I have encountered a few sites/applications that dont work properly in chrome   Meh  still a much better solution than IE	Excellent browser but has had a few issues with the more recent versions   Maybe its time for a complete system rebuild

12778	The best email service ever existed	nice idea  not the best ui ive seen		
53209	hai2      hehehehe give me follower more than 100 pless :p		
12776	A huge CMS from scratch  but at the same time very easy to scale down and customize to your needs !	its ok  but getting extremely tired of all this quizzes  Can people either stop taking them or give us a chance to block ALL quizzes and not just 1 specific!!	even beter now with multi account suppport =)		
67850	So lightweight and snappy    something that FireFox can no longer claim  unfortunately		
62163	Im new On Twitter But I Very Like It But Remember Twitter Is Not a chat		
44353	Programming for the iPhone is much easier now   if only theyd make memory management more transparent		
8840	My favorite piece of software  period	Simple  intuitive email  raised the bar for all other webmail services		
75475	Wikipedia is the best overall resource Ive used PERIOD	Best browser IMO		
66526	SU is unique among bookmarking and related sites  I like using it  The social elements of it are lacking (or just not really happening)  though		
48717	I have drunk the kool aid and now I can run a four minute mile with Google at my side!		
543	My premium e mail client	The easiest bloging tool which is becoming more and more addictive	Simply amazing photo hosting site	Little fox is not so little any more	With more friends joining in its the best place on the web;)		
31042	prefer Tumblr as it is faster  but Flickr is handy	For a non programmer like me  Wordpress and its army of plugins is the bizniss		
32373	Good  But a complete memory hog	Fantastic for finding new music  even if its far from mainstream!	Its whatever you want it to be  Without it  blippr wouldnt exist!	Good for connecting with people you may not otherwise keep in touch with  But bloated  applications are unstable  chat is rarely working   too much like myspace	Does everything it needs to and is stable  Never have to worry about running out of space	Good   but lacking the equivalent of Firefoxs extensions  Till it has add on support  Im staying with Firefox		
50189	I  am  new  to  twitter   I  actually  saw  it  on  the  CNN  news  channel		
8835	Excellent service for both discovering new sites and bookmarking the ones you like!	Amazing app  the columns feature is great!	Simply the best! Has everything one needs [+ more] for FREE! :)

11451	Ive been addicted to Twitter since the moment I signed up  which was roughly a year after its launch	I love everything about Google  Its just perfect		
36731	Also in my Top 5  Dont like that you can only fast forward so many times  but by creating a new station you can get around that  Great suggestions	Definitely in my music top 5  Love the suggestions  love the variety  love the scrobbling from multiple sources  love the idea  love that its free!

10127	yes they are smug  but they have the bestest search engine		
11458	I just love twitter! Perfect to stay in touch with friends   even more  to sat in touch with the world and keep track of whats going on around me :))		
10126	Scrobbles my music and keeps track of what I am listening and lets me see what my friends are listening to  Great customisable online radio too	A really good multi im client out there  Very functional and good looking but bulky and cumbersome at times  Can improve a lot and has got potential to be best!	The best microblogging platform cum social aggregator site out there  Whatever is out there friendfeed is two steps ahead in terms of thought and action	Am a huge fan of firefox  Cant live w/o it  Totally changed the way I use internet! The add ons make it so functional and knockout every other browser out there	One of the best things on the internet right now  It is status updates+blogging+im+networking+awesomeness	Simple  elegant  effective and a great community  Beats all other photo sites by miles	Fast  Very fast  thats good  Simple  too simple  Thats bad  Having no add ons is a severe handicap  Several sites still dont run properly on it	life becomes so simple with this brilliant note taking app which creates various notebooks and keeps all ur notes at one place accessible over the cloud

92817	Its awesome   Much better than Wordpress

58937	porque soy una gatita chula		
8883	I cannot express in words how much I love Mashable! Its the first email I open when I get to work and it takes priority over the next 30 minutes  Best source	Good for online shelf  Appearance wise this is the best of the virtual shelves  Clear cover pics and fancy cases	I really like iTunes  I know most hate having to pay but aside from that I love the fact that I can buy a cd at 3:15am and have it loud & clear in a minute	I used to love it  now it becomes closer facespace every day  But it is the easiest way to keep in contact with far away friends	I like it for quickly keeping bookmarks  Good at sorting through tags and categories	Lots of options and control for all Twitter accounts	Great site  lots of info & interesting sites  I have found some really neat things via Digg  But at times I wish theyd believe me that my submission is unique	Would the world still rotate on its axis if Google ceased to exist? Google would be there to document the event anyway  I bet  What doesnt Google do?	Good page source  Submission process is a bit tiring  but keeps info relevant for the most part	Best thing about Twitterrific is the bird sounds it makes that annoy the hell out of anyone in the room with you  Priceless amusement!	Extensive and comprehensive  My favorite online library site  Definitely the best web library for all info regarding the book world	Im waiting for the day when Google simply doesnt blow my mind  Google Earth vastly went beyond anything I had expected of it	Works great  I find it easy to navigate and customize  I need a bigger bookmarks bar though	Fun for those times you have time  Takes you to some rarely seen sites that should be seen more often  Also helps organize your personal favorites	I like it too  good of Mashable to buy it and inform me about it! Great site		
45646	Google = My favorite verb

74991	yeahhh stop reaning not bad for twitter app		
590	Im blipping that I love the IDEA of it   Cant wait to use it in practice!	Gmail redefined email for me   If I could use it for everything I would   It is nearly perfect	This has quickly replaced firefox for me during all normal browsing   I love it  [Also love have an irrational love of google    so yeah]		
93274	twitter is the best way to connect to your friends		
47376	i llike friends who are good to other friends and truthful

81290	Have been using it more since getting a netbook    i find it requires a decent size screen		
81292	Its simply brilliant  Its based on the same philosophy as 37signalss services  I bet it will have a lot of cool features in the future		
14459	My boyfriend just turned me on to Google Reader  I can now easily surf all of my news  including Mashable and Digg at the click of ONE button and in only 1 Tab!	I think its a great communication and networking tool  plus  its fun to sit and read through what others are doing at the exact same moment you are!	i love the flexibility google docs allows with my financial docs   its all there  no matter what PC im on	Only been using it a short while  but seems okay so far	I often refer to IMDB for info on movies  actors  and upcoming films!	I love Firefox  I have converted many friends to it  far away from IE  The customization it has is just fantastic!		
13128	Has its flaws but generally speaking a revolution in communication  I use it for work and hobbies  Its great for news debate and its a great networking tool	The best way to get your twitter and facebook updates & keep them organised  The layout is simple & clear  you can create groups & it has useful link shortner		
71019	The shopping search and cashback feature are great		
72349	lets see         idont have much idea?

39744	Makes a helluva lot of user satisfaction / PR mistakes but still the best social network out there	Best business network out there  Could be a bit better in terms of its new addon functionality e g  blog & slideshare integration	Good  but prefer to use Twitter directly on the mobile	While the mobile browser itself is good  the mobile emulator is absolutely excellent for testing mobile websites	Our desktop Twitter app of choice  Very handy for multiple accounts (office  personal etc) and lots of easy to use functionality without crowding the interface	Probably the simplest and most usable Firefox   Twitter plugin	Brilliant for playing specific tracks  The radio function needs improvement badly	Probably the most use app on our PCs	Usually interesting  I still prefer TechCrunch for getting news first	Extremely handy tool	Interesting  but not the most intuitive interface  Sharing files often requires a bit of hand holding with new users	Very cool  especially avoids need for Real Audio and other crappy players	Very cool  but pointless for daily use	Very useful if you want to grow your Twitter reach  However  the service can be quite slow	Looks really cool  in terms of function  but I dont like having their brand look so prominent on our site	Nice to have  easy to use	Good  good stuff	Significant improvements over XP and Vista  Could be faster to boot  The inability to pin Mini Media Player to taskbar is a fail point	Definitely the most powerful image editor  Using it for years  and still continue to discover cool new features	Probably the best resource for stock photography	Really neat stuff  and especially handy for quick edits to Flickr images  Would help if they expanded the functionality on Flickr  E g  paintbrush tool	Handy  but not very sleek  Good for tweet categorisation	Love how much better Office 2007 is than Office XP  Lots more interesting features  Outlook 2007 should have HTML email support though	Undeniably the best blog platform  Possibly the most powerful CMS too	Interesting  Not sure if it will replace IMDB for movie recommendations  but      time will tell	Still good  Does exactly what it says on the box and has been doing so for almost as long as the Internets been around	Good for the lazy / photoshop challenged	Great concept  We use it all the time	Brilliant  Ground breaking	Not Microsofts best OS  XP and Windows 7 both out classed Vista	Definitely our favourite free Anti Virus software	The definitive movie database  Design looks a bit dated though  and not very interactive	This is their original  and still their best piece of technology ever

46011	Im however still annoyed that Apple insist to use iTunes for most of their programs  Especially Apple tv  which is useless as long as i runs through iTunes	Still trying to figure out what to use it for	Great video player that can play almost any format		
15774	it has some very interesting features to connect all of us regular folks together with the crazy overspeeding world out there		
50104	nice app  great stuff		
39728	Default URL trimmer for Twitter  and I use it sometimes	Only Windows  Puuuu  But the accounts actually use XMPP/Jabber	Very cool for people with low space on their hard drive	Addicted to it like everybody!	And loving it thanks to Reader2Twitter	An decent open source Photoshop	Youll find many great sites	Google Analytics is glaring stats	But alas flickrs better	I love it! (Especially the latest version  but it wont broadcast to FriendFeed)	Cool tech blog	Simply *THE BEST* e mail client out there	I use Identi ca as a alternate source for Twitter	I love the concept and I have been invited as well  Quite cool  Id say	I like Disqus  in it that in many ways	Like the compelling upload video & picture site   but I dont use it and is owned by the News Corp	Tries its best to do what it does  but I think it needs MOAR work	I like it! It is simply good	Newbies to computers will love it! I love it too!	95% of people use it! I do too! Love the services!	It is good for finding information  but is spammed alot	Its OK  but it really wants you to pay :(	Its a great client for Twitter  I personally use it  but hate its Facebook support	My all time browser behind Opera  :P	Alerting me when social networking goes wild	I had a Yahoo! account for it  so    (I dont use it much  but used to)	I use it for my blog and it is great!	OK and decent  but I think Ubuntu is a bit better	I love it! I even got a profile on it! (Only thing is that it is too popular)	Its Fine  prevented an iframe attack	Parts are free software  but the code to the browser isnt  Arora is a bit better		
9301	Clean interface  Google still needs to work out some JavaScript issues so that it is compatible with more web2 0 apps	No other email client compares to Gmail		
11382	Love it ! Fast and light  what do you need more ?		
15740	great way to share pictures on the go with friends  old and new

63422	Gmail provides good and quick service  it has added so much new and latest supports to its services   yeah  but gmail apps for window mobile are required		
75402	Great concept but this doesnt always work in practice! Improved accuracy would make this much more useful  Super app to discover music though!	This is THE definitive Twitter client app on the iPhone! Sexy and functional! Does everything you need it to do and more!	As a first generation Apple iPhone user who upgraded to the 3G and then 3GS  the OS 3 0 brought so much new features which took the platform to a new level!	Absolutely awesome music streaming service and I love the premium subscription which lets you use this on your iPhone and save off line playlists!	Mashable is the most amazing social media blog out there and I must confess that I honestly use this on a daily basis!	Lets keep this short and sweet! For that is what blippr is all about!	A much more powerful  faster  innovative and secure web browser  There are extensions for almost anything  Choose Firefox for a great web browsing experience	Wikipedia is a great concept but I feel that it is very much bloated and usefulness as well as reliability can be very questionable!	YouTube is the top social media innovation of the decade! I love it and use it daily!	I love the refinements in the user interface in Windows 7  Pinning icons for your most used programs to the taskbar adds sophistication  Sexy  fast and simple!

11387	Much better with a Wacom or something like that ;)	I really like using Safari on my Mac but not on Windows platforms  Also I found S4 much more memory expensive that S3 but maybe is just my impression	The best desktop app for using Twitter  Runs over Adobe Air so you can use it en Windows / Mac / Linux  Unfortunately it has a memory leak   200mb of my RAM now	I just cant imagine internet wo Wikipedia  Cooperative knowledge works and roolez :)		
15748	Blows every other social networking and location based site out of the water  Inline pictures  comment capabilities  solid privacy features & a great community!		
39714	I wish it was easier to find old messages  once you trash them or send them  its like a needle in a haystack  is this beta still? LOL	Couldnt live without twitter   check with me in 1 year  it could go the way of MySpace ;)		
50117	awesome blogging platform with an excellent backend		
10058	See the world from your door step   know where youre heading to and with street view   guess I cant lost as easily now   Just need to plan ahead		
15746	Twitter can be so much more than a microblog/social network  If you want  it can condense your whole online life 140 characters at a time	A good blend between other blogging apps and Twitter  Its like blogging express  Couldnt be easier to use yet still suitable for advanced bloggers		
95008	Its not easy to describe it but really I cant open firefox without opening twitter tab  it became of primary websites I open daily  #thankstwitter4	The best of the best with the best!		
11390	Simply the best  End of!	I prefer this over Discus & Im a Wordpress follower  It also got bought up by Automattic (Wordpress developers) so it makes sense  It has plugins now too!		
10062	the place to update people i actually know

This a media album/scrapbook style blog  Works well for me		
15757	Waiting for better integration with AI	Very cost effective    when pirated	By far the fastest  Just needs AdBlock

95870	google is becoming evil however much we all like it

10909	I like it and feel that it will be improved in areas where it is not (being in alpha)		
10908	Easy to keep up with certain timely events  such as sports events  but becomes cumbersome at times; often  too many personal tweets from business oriented sites		
90180	I like Buzz and I think well see a lot of improvements as we go along		
9362	its OK   but not so revolutionar as people thinking    simply OK   :)	I said I love it    :D		
9360	I dont like being followed but if I can get a hot deal on sunglasses Im in!		
56271	cool  very cool  I am new here exploring	lets see  but looks it will be veeery good!		
90184	Its a smart  strategic move on Googles part since it allows them to take advantage of their whole platform on Android handsets (duh)		
83898	LOVED THAT SORORITY LIFE !		
10912	one of the best photo media sites ive ever come across  i urge everyone to get at least the free account if not the pro account  Its worth it by the way	i havent tried it much  but so far so good		
82563	i just like it and also can also learn from it :)		
29521	Mixed feelings  Phishtube good  Tila Tequila  well  journalists who claim twitter is changing our lives should be forced to watch her cam show  :P	Its great but if youve been around online communication awhile it looks more like a radical re imagining of irc than something new		
81234	I travel so much  its great to find new places		
13189	Cant make it through the day without a lil Mashable!		
49131	I HAVE JUST JOIN IT SO I HAVE RIGHT NOW NO REVIEW

13196	Mashable is my favorite resource for keeping up with social media		
93204	Its a really fun app  I just wish more people had it so we could all share the fun!	Its the best blog Ive ever used   I cant wait to try hosting on my own site		
37146	I wasnt much of a Vista fan   in fact  never upgraded to it  only used it on a friends computer once  BUT  Windows 7   Simply Beautiful! Fast & Smooth!	I love the idea behind this  Servers seem a bit sluggish though  ahhh  and a 504 error while trying to post THIS! needs some work

1400	its the juggernaut of web video		
82553	Lost 80% of the songs on my imeem playlists    songs that came from imeem  I despise these myspace dipshts  The big question: What site replaces imeem the best?		
82554	i love the game its great		
38478	Its user interface is awesome  but so is the browser itself  It renders pages accurately  and fast  Trumps Firefox in my opinion		
81220	i need a female friend		
14492	This is the only RSS feed colletor service I use  I simply love it the concept of RSS  Would love to see the concept of filters in GReader!	Twitter is addictive  It just gets easier to share thanks to Mobile Tweeting and firefox plugins  Its truly Micro Blogging		
13161	I have a love/hate with Yelp   love that it uncovers local places that wouldnt get noticed by media  but hate the meaningless star ratings system		
13162	Cant remember what I did before! Tremendous tool for realizing how the planet is not that big and were all very similar		
39795	Its best   but competitors are also performing   Now a days I am also opting for bing

62972	its the easies way to blog share ideas		
9380	This is really good  For all the stuff that you cant possibly get to read   file them into your Evernote account and access them on Mac  PC  web and iPhone		
8053	Blippr beat me in the eye with a stick	Robust and clean! Integrated chat  OCD enabling features  Its awesome and constantly getting better		
29508	Facebook is for your real friends  Twitter is for your online friends  Thats the way I look at it		
61639	Im a little slow on it  but am learning pretty quick dont love it dont hate it but im in between		
85611	Love the conversations in realtime  In that sense  is better than Facebook	I like the @replies in every profile  Also  is very useful the shorten link  daily question and photo features  The bad is that I cant create groups	Good organization: labels  filters  starred  No more spam in inbox (ok  almost)  I like labs  but is difficult to find what is enable		
13169	It has a lot of useful information		
81251	Useful to keep track of my tasks for various projects  Good reminder functionality

39783	Very fast and simple  Great combination	great app in your iphone  I use it a lot!		
73633	The fastest browser option  but still lacks something to become my browser of choice	A great browser with an absurd potential  i hope the upcoming versions fix the bloating problems though		
38455	Its definitely an excellent browser but I still prefer to use Firefox  Its just what Im used to now		
9390	Facebook is a great tool for professional and personal contact management to keep up with people	Firefox has been my fav browser for years now  Chrome is giving it a run for money on the speed side		
90191	like all these social networks there is a learning curve but Buzz shows great promise still test driving and trying to collapse the overly long threads!		
90194	It seamlessly works with the rest of my google stuff and the connections are savvy and helpful	Google analytics makes me look really smart  Which is quite an accomplishment		
90195	One of the most helpful tools i use	Can be great when you want to keep in touch with friends but can be a perfect tool to waste your time		
34092	By far the best search engine	I like it  I like the ad ons  but Ill stick with chrome  its much faster		
10901	The best of the online feed readers  methinks		
2755	OMG TWITTER IS NUMBER ONE!		
1422	Went from like to love   Great site  I want more	Really good source of information from the obscure to the current	Its novelty has worn off about 6 months ago  but it still serves a purpose  Good for networking and connecting w/ old friends	Great resource for photo sharing and exploring	Its cool & handy  but I honestly dont use it enough often forgetting that I have an account	Good  solid app  Fun and easy to use	Not for the weak of heart  but once you get it  you get it   Great application	Great blog site   Huge fan	One of the greatest creations since the pencil sharpener  Great to review pop culture stuff  Now if it would only add a comics section	Wish I used it more  but I like what Ive seen so far		
1421	One of the best things to hit the web since Twitter  Blippr should be integrated with every site  :)	Coda is extremely clean and easy to use	combines the function of a blog with community extremely well  I love posting my own content as much as reading what others have to say	A beautiful way to display your book collection on the internet	I really wish I had more reason to use virb  The design interface is simply beautiful and elegant	Best tool to stay connected on the internet and off the computer

77374	Definitely at the forefront of The Social Evolution		
76043	Well  its only problem is that it really eats up the system memory after some time  and goes slow with that  It really should have many processes  like chrome		
52074	Im adicted to facebook its my fav!		
77377	Great for sharing photos	Its awesome  but for some reason I love Tumblr waayy more	Best browser  the one I use the most  Cant beat the addons!	Easy to customize theme  awesome functionality  and slick features make this my favorite twitter client	Totally awesome  one of the things I do the most		
12818	Great money management tool for the every person  Manage your finances through the web or through your iPhone		
1476	I use gmail and google hosted email for my domains   What I like best is the mobile integration and the ability to get ALL my Google stuff on my iPhone		
91668	Im so addicted to facebook  Im on it 24 7 like yea!		
5836	Fan fucking tastic	Great functions but absolutely pig ugly	At last  a method of statistically proving my music taste is superior to your music taste	As much as I like its utility  I am also often furious at it for its shortcomings	The fact it is so often accurate is terrifying proof that we will soon all be killed by robots	Its getting there  but perhaps feels a bit stale   Spotlight search is the best though	Really? Does it need to be explained why Google is so great?	Future of the music industry? Probably not  but useful    especially when youre drunk and have to find this one song	Good lord  this thing is consuming me	Throw away your phone  its redundant		
64052	I luv it so much  This is wonderful experience to meet so many people in the world		
68422	Its basically the new God		
39044	Best RSS feed reader on the market  and the best thing about it is that its Social and lets you interact with others and share you feeds	Awesome app  Mini blog and so much much more :D		
42691	im new to the twitter thing		
65399	I watched the wave video and really liked it alot! Im just mad i havnt got an invite yet!	I like it  its ok  I wish it had more options like adding game app! Im new to Twitter maybe i havnt figured it all out yet?		
1492	I really dont know why  or what to use it for   I just know that I love it    ;D	Who doesnt like Facebook ?? Isnt everyone on it no matter if you like it or not ?	It is a good and stable browser   Not perfect but what browser is?	Really the best torrent client for windows as I remember it :D	Come on Google is like the blood of the internet   How doesnt like it ?		
56440	eu adoro mto tdo isso        Facebook Ã© tdo de bom		
77360	its fast  adaptable  reliable   what more is there to say?		
78690	hey guys finally i got the time to log on

5849	use IMDB ALL the time	kinda weird and limited	helps make the machine work better	some of it is sort of Vader tho	good is getting better   the horrendous display quality of some of it is annoying	dont use it as much as blip fm right now but might later	it works well enough for when I need a torrent proggie which is not everyday	every time a feed breaks it spits it out and the feed has 2 b readded  annoying amount of babysitting	one of the best things about the internet	seems awfully bloated but hey gotta synch my Ipod	my 1st string browser   crashes and is a mem hog at times tho	wouldnt use anything else  but blogging is becoming very 2005	good is getting better	dont use it as much as one might think I would  use Google Maps online much more		
32412	 OH THIS COOL YEH YOU GOT THE RIGHT STUFF GIVE IT TO ME BABY   NOW TALKING OH OH I JUST BLIPPED MY SELF  EXCUSE ME!		
78699	fresh and simple  especialli no adds	much better than baidu		
1488	Alongside TechCrunch  Mashable is up there in my top blogs to read  Its great for finding new information on some of your favorite social networks	Google Wave  is a revolutionary way of communicating  But its no replacement for Email  Its far from it  Currently Wave is just another new Social Network		
12828	I have approx 550 feeds and i love that I can tag feeds of interest and add sites to my RSS notes which use the same tags Its the ultimate tool for web research		
90328	Tendulkar is very great personality &such abig guy		
12822	Really easy and simple to use	Seamless cross platform  cross browser  multi workstation file sharing		
65393	thanks twitter 4 giving me apportunity to join with new friends		
94721	The best of anything you could ever think of  Useful  respectful  trendy  geeky  mobile    and the list goes on!		
90363	Talks about subjects that other people dont want or prefer us not to talk about  I appreciate the nice clean subjects  Nothing crude  either  Even corp s don		
91693	The best gift in the history of gift giving!!!! Love it  How did i ever live without it		
70750	Follow me on twitter:  http://www twitter com/apurvgourav	Google buzz same as twitter		
67107	Gmail is amazing     I use it for everything    literally		
90366	use it everyday :)		
77391	Most practical app to manage and organize RSS feeds !		
45719	It is the technology that will refine the telegraphic abilities of our brain and the receptors in our cells in ways we cannot even imagine yet    It is Amazing!		
77394	Endless entertainment and information		
76063	Ok  I used to totally love it  Now that I guess myspace bought it  it  SUCKS  I guess Ill find another music/video site that has not sold out to myspace		
77398	only had it for 24 hours and its very sleak  Only gripe so far is that I need to attach it to my PC and dont see the seemless cloud connectivity to gmail	Excellent for projects and collaboration where teams are distributed indifferent cities and contintents  Finding it difficult to convert some people tho	I used to use Flickr all the time but after my Pro membership lapsed  I found myself using Picasa more because of the offline and online capabilities		
77399	I just want to say goodbye to the Windows world  and Google looks likely to help me do that  I will never forgive Microsoft for the pile of s***t called Vista		
94716	Just started now  its begining but i started liking it http://www fashno com		
69760	I love google wave i can manage my project on it with my colleagues		
70749	Its just beta so far  but I think it looks cute  Though  I was kind of hoping that it would be able to kill msn  But Im having doubts		
68444	Firefox is a very fast browser  is supporting neat all sorts of programming languages and works on every operating system very good  Its just the best browser		
70767	youtube is on of the best websites ever!		
45701	Super fast  simple UI  in my opinion an amazing browser  which is only lacking in plug in support		
91683	Checking out the Blippr Review pluggin		
91689	Better organized and faster than Hotmail  Prefer it over any other email hosting company	Its useless without very many contacts  otherwise itd be awesome!		
90358	the most entertaining website!! all of us would have been so deprived without it!	Cant imagine life without without gmail!!		
5873	Twitter gets a lot of my attention	Gluing content together from the fragmented Social Media scene is important for #lifestreaming   FriendFeed com makes that easy  Just needs duplicate detection!		
90357	its just so easy to use  but it would be nice to be able to use lists  because now its not very clear with all the posts in one big list		
56461	FB stay connected with friends and watch those people you never really liked try to be your friends		
40015	i use google in daily conversation    its become a part of our culture		
90350	Great news and comment  and some great functionality  Especially love ncluds new Mashable app  although some sort of mashable:// URL would be nice!		
3208	Small and efficient  what more do you want?	Transparent file sync  backup and sharing solution  Comes with 2Gb free	Very simple solution for remembering things on the web you want to check out later	Great webbased messenger  supports msn  gtalk  yahoo  icq etc  Now with a cool iphone app to make it even better!	Keep your text/audio/video notes everywhere  Has web  desktop and iphone clients	Great interface  non destructive editing and web sync	No nonsense full featured music player for Windows	Prefer this over Twinkle and Twitterfon  even if its a payed app	Twitter seems to be really taking off   Like it because it is (still) so simple and basic	Great open source vector graphics editor  good alternative for Ilustrator		
55135	i want to join with twitter		
81401	The new CV creator is just great !		
30694	Best browser out there so far  I wish Safari would learn from them		
12804	My favorite comment system but I maybe slightly bias   heh		
30690	Started out sceptical using Twitter  but can say now that I am addicted to it  As Mickey D would say loving it		
55138	its mah first tym so lets see		
56465	its just great  info in the moment!		
90348	love it  its new and does need lots of work but im positive google will work out all the issues it has and make it a major player		
88038	Love it and totally addicted to it  Fortunatly I have to use it at work ;)	Very easy in use  functional no extra flashy things  Like it a lot	Best by far  no problems at all		
88036	clean  simple interface and functionality    Gmail is great		
88065	I LIKE IT BECAUSE EVERYTIME A NEW SONG CUMS OUT ITS ON THERE AND U CAN LEARN DANCES		
5881	Its hard to tell right now  but the integration of several services in one place is potentially useful  I still post more Twitter updates than Buzz ones though		
40002	About the only Reader that works really well  Google does it better than anyone else  Except havent found how to rename Labels  Strange blip	I trust Mashable for my Web 2 0 and social technologies news  Although it does not work well with my Firefox  hrmpph	Lean and mean  Fast and sprightly  Well done  Google		
94746	One of the greatest think tank in the world		
90388	Interesting  powerful but messy (UI & all the stuff that has been discussed since the release)		
56473	isnt it fascinating  thats what we need from time to time		
82758	I used it a week  but seemed one of not that many    Twitter  facebook are simply too popular    Twitter already location aware and facebook will follow  march		
61822	Twitter   my fav place to go  when in depressed!		
82759	yup   while it was not fighting with my phishing filter it was great		
81437	another fantastic Tool from my beloved Google  Tkank You :D		
49290	IF YOU FOLLOW THE RIGHT PEOPLE THEN ITS A GREAT INFORMATION FLOW TOOL see who I follow @Globalcide		
81433	Only Bill Gates on twitter     mrrrfff		
8902	The fastest meaning of sharing informations		
70769	Very interactive and user friendly  Interactions are easy and informative  ITs got cool applications too to keep you hooked up		
30688	Better than IE  not as good as Firefox or Chrome  but Unite puts it in another league entirely!		
8903	Im chatting with Pete Cashmore now and he suggested I check out blippr   Im going to rate Twitter  b/c obviously  I think its awesome		
43983	What can I ask more from Gmail  The best e mail around without a doubt	Excellent is all what I can say about this  :)		
94731	My tech bible :)		
68466	Windows 7 an improvement on Vista which caused me no end of pain since its release  The hibernation works properly too  Still prefer OSX for my primary machine	The Google Wave preview takes a little getting used to  It will only come into its own when the floodgates open and everyone you know/work/share has access		
8920	I love GMail  But I think there is so much more that Google should do with mail  Google just is not cutting edge anymore	Twitter has become a commodity for some of us  Nevertheless  I think  should Facebook get better  it might be able to render twitter obsolete	The whole thing with IE security holes is so misleading  FF has even more holes  Chrome has holes  They all have  IE is at least as fast and at least as safe		
70782	Functionality is great however somewhat limiting on layouts   I also dont like that its not integrated with AdSense  however integration in general is very good		
89380	I love the games & being able to connect with old & new friends alike  I keep UTD w/current events & learn about new things  All around a great site		
43980	I have something to read thanks to the useful people I follow  Its always interesting to have news on tech world in an efficient  filtered and workless way  :)		
42656	Without question  the best browser there is  Add ons and extensions for everything	Love it & love it more now that theres a Blackberry app for it	Whats not to love? Its fast replacing following blogs for me  And allows virtual attendance of conferences	Nice app & social tool for managing Twitter & Facebook  Some nifty extras as well	Cool way to browse your pics; the 3D view/scroll is smart  Some nice GUI features too  Like it  although non essential in the grand scheme of things		
43988	i just started bt hey

8913	Good fun  useful and addictive

8925	Since i found the watch there i have been looking for   Love the way it looks  moves and tweets about stuff		
88880	Best OS from Microsoft so far	Fast browser with support for latest technologies  No longer supports some widely used technologies though		
80907	Firefox blows goatz		
48854	I resisted it for so long and now I wonder why	Some way to go before its considered good    Its fast  but its CPU/memory footprint leaves a lot to be desired	Great  but clunky  Would like to see Facebook style photo layout (click for next etc) and more space for free accounts	Its great  but its become so bloated in the past few versions that I tend to only use it now as a last resort  I dont need links  uploads  templates etc	Firefox made me switch from what was then my favourite browser   IE  How little I knew	Love it  Much better than the iPhone		
11591	First app Ive ever actually paid for   Love that it handles my multiple twitter accounts		
8941	Its really hit the mainstream media recently  I use it to find out and echo topics of interest to my professional life  Its been great so far		
10260	Great software even in beta! TweetDeck gives Twitter an IM like interface with alerts and a slew of features including translating tweets!		
67954	Works well  most of the complaints I see from people areOMG IT IS DIFFERENT FROM XP! and WHY DOESNT IT WORK ON THIS OLD COMPUTER? but it works fine	One of the Best apps out there  And deffinatily the best im client	Kicks firefoxs ass	i like the new streaming function		
11590	Brilliant  Im not saying its better than Google  but perhaps better than Google News (/any other news website)  :)		
47520	Unlike Myspace  Facebook is populated largely by people who go by their real names  Its great getting back in touch with old classmates  coworkers  and friends		
10262	Awesome backgrounds! Check mine here http://twitter com/iSnake		
67959	Fast  lightweight  secure   What else does one need in a browser		
34215	good way to find new people on twitter	i like the idea but still i dont get the big picture  google creating its own facebook?	good way to kill time  and very useful in finding random things		
35545	Got hooked with Twitter already  in fact I get to open my Twitter page more than any other social network sites I have  It gives more info  etc		
34213	I love it and use feedly on Firefox to read it as a magazine		
86218	like their shares moved a lot in the right direction  north ^		
11595	Its a great way of keeping track of what friends and acquaintances are doing  but at the expense of a multitude of really crappy apps inside	This is my brain on super strong  knowledge increasing  free from all sideeffects except the addiction drugs  Any questions?	Getting a bit convoluted and bloated  it still is the reference app for any kind of graphics work more advanced than what Lightroom provides	Not accessible enough  though    I never remember to go there  Good for killing a couple of hours  though!	The best way to share pictures online! The groups dont work at all the way I would like them  but as a photo sharing site  pretty much unbeatable!	The benchmark against which all other web browsers have to measure themselves  When Im on my Mac  I still use Safari  though    Firefox everywhere else!	It is an amazing step up from Tiger    The reference OS	I tried to stay away for a long time    But I finally got it  Like the new facebook stream  only more alive!	Now if I could only keep up a blog for longer than two weeks	I wish I had photographed myself when realizing this wasnt just about the web apps    Books  games  movies  music    This is soooo awesome!	The problem with relaying social network information is duplicates  so its less of a fit for me since I started twittering in addition to facebook	Keeping track of all my songs for new and interesting music recommendations  or listening to my library when I am away is real nice	The idea is great  Problem is  noone I know is using it  So for me  its just a comment system that works pretty much just like any other  Shame	I just dont read RSS like I used to    But if I were  google reader would be where I would be doing it!	The hub of my digital life! The smart playlists  iTunes U and Podcast support makes this the go to app for all my listening related desires!	So ubiquitous  I just cant imagine my life without it anymore		
36872	Informative  A reliable source for the latest innovations and trends in social media		
15953	More indispensable by the day  but they need to offer a client for S60 devices :( Nokia outsell the #2 and #3 cell phone makers combined FFS!	Its my media center of choice now  just wish it didnt crash so much !	Went crazy at the start trying to get it via proxy  Now Miro has filled the void for the most part	Great people can buzz you on your mobile  without the app even being opened	Keeps my various web identities organized and just a click away  Support are very responsive also  Would love if Nimbuzz and Digsby partnered :)	But I havent devoted time to become adept with it		
44492	Best collection of high production and commercial video available free on the internet  but unfortunately most of it isnt viewable outside of the United State		
88875	Twitter is an objective proof that the world is flat  Few words  learning to get to the point		
8932	Can do a lot and if not  there is a plugin that can  Great stuff		
8933	The best web based email Ive ever used and an integral part of my daily life	After two years of use Twitter has become one of my most important tools for communication  A great place to share ideas	@tweetdeck : The best Twitter app available  Cross platform too  which is nice  If only it could handle multiple accounts		
11596	not microsoft  what else do I need to say?		
87543	You tube is it  the other day I was listening to alternative music of the 80 s  such as the Chamelions echo And The BunnyMen and Exct    blew my mind!   ro

12891	In my opinion the best Twitter client for iPhone	I chose Seesmic especially for its powerful multiple account management  Great tool!	Great  fast and easy tool	Before I thought it was useless  Now I know Twitter is a good way to stay in touch with people you know  to meet new friends and to gain/share knowledge	Really simple and a lot of choice to give your Twitter page your own look and feel		
8950	Coolest app after gmail! OK  lets sfeed some stuff now :)	Best app ever! :)		
8951	I love the way you can combine clothes into sets		
27901	too good to be true :D

15928	Fast  fast fast and furious		
34204	is a interesting page ilike it		
31175	I use Wikipedia every day  amazing how many different and obscure topics it has information on	Enormous library of songs  just choose one and listen  easy	Great site for the latest news on Twitter and other social networking sites  always useful  always informative  always up to date	Great comprehensive music library  fast streaming  easy to share playlists  The best streaming app available	Bingll have to go a long way to beat this  Always improving  always expanding	Great service  literally expanded my music knowledge hundredfold  Found loads of artists I never knew before  great recommendations	Chrome is in its infancy  and as such  I cant really judge  but it is bite the back of your hand fast  just needs the extendability of FF		
31174	i wish they would adopt some of chromes design (button positioning a lot better with chrome)	sorry!! chrome won me over		
80941	This is my first day but i love it already   Its quick and easy to use  WOOHOO at last lol

35530	I was using v 0 3 & that worked great! v0 4 (on 2 PCs) runs really slow! Cant seem to get it to work properly		
11561	Twitter is where you can talk to a crowd yet listen to select individuals based on who they are  who they listen to and what theyre talking about  @gelbendorf		
92911	Didnt think much about it at first  but have been having a lot of fun with it within the past week or so!	Once I got on Facebook I never went back to MySpace  and I havent missed the MySpace clutter or spammers since!

Perfect for searching for specific things without caring which site you end up at   and then keeping them!	All you need to monitor your site performance and its free  Cant ask for more	It has its uses  but comes with WAY too much rubbish	Being able to get my most used files from anywhere via the iPhone or any PC is brilliant  And so simple  A+	I love it and I cant really explain why  I can see its potential but havent tapped it yet	Still my go to when looking for all round functionality  Some are catching it up (Seesmic!) but not quite there yet

85787	As someone whos not comfy with face to face interactions  I loved how FB helped me break the ice among my colleagues by sharing snarks and jokes  :)	In less than 15 minutes  my mom knew how to (micro)blog! Thanks  Tumblr!	My go to site for quick infos   assignments  celeb bios  comparison of apps features  rumored devs  movie summaries/spoilers  etc  Beware of grammar potholes	Name it  VLC plays it  Minor quibble: could use some pretty fying  interface wise		
13236	I like it  but dislike having to always qualify all my tasks with things like dates and locations  Needs the ability to be more simple	awesome for tweeting! Lives happily in the background without making me feel smothered with tweets  Icon could NOT be cuter!		
14564	It is teh shizzle  and allows for the best  most fast and functional AND cleanest interface  and is really easy to use  Without this  I wouldnt e mail so much		
76834	Great company  hope it keeps the good job (innovation  ethics  creativity   )

43099	I cant believe I didnt find this before  I dont know where I was when BJ Thomas was at the top of his game I guess they didnt show videos then like now		
9423	Use it for sharing sites with friends  not so much for tagging itself		
95134	I <3 Gmail   Works well on every platform Ive used it  tons of room and lots of connectivity   Whats not to like?	TweetDeck is AWESOME!  The iPhone/iPod version has some bugs and the Facebook connectivity needs some UI help but other than that    GREAT!	Its ok  but all these light boxes are a bit annoying	Its ok  it needs to have a lot more content to be excellent though   I really appreciate the convenience  but what I want to watch is never on there	Dropbox is one of the most fantastic pieces of online software that i have found   No flash drive? No problem  use Dropbox	Who doesnt like YouTube?  Yeah  theres a lot of crap on it  and it can be glitchy  but if your subscribed to the right people  can be a good way to burn time

51566	Wonderfully useful! I follow Mashable on Twitter and check the blog at least once a day for reviews  news and really helpful lists	Most useful Twitter app because it has so many options   searches  directory  customized columns and more  Only thing lacking: ability to schedule tweets		
13202	Easy to pull in various IM accounts and social networking tools  Runs a little slow  but simplifies my life	Better than other Twitter apps Ive tried  but I havent really pushed it yet  Only 1 account and dont use the favorites feature		
48781	This is the application that will change my world		
38504	Its great  As simple or as complex as you want	Chromes become my default browser on my Windows machines  I love the minimalist design  I just wish theyd make Mac and Linux versions already		
10181	You can come out with new versions of all the other browsers  but unless you make it as extensible as Firefox  it wont make me switch		
63550	chat to people ill miss		
15872	It took a little bit to understand how to really use it  but Twitter is great with the right Twitter app

I allways turn to StumbleUpon when I am  looking for something new  and it never fails to deliver	My favorite blog  it has to be included in my daily reads	I love the service  but the selection of movies to watch instantly is modest  But I have found some very good ones on it  As they add more movies I will use it	It is one of my main sources for new software and keeping up with what is going on		
10182	I love the recommended music station	Hulu    interfering with my productivity since 2007	Its a shame that its being overrun with spam  Its making me like Craigslist less and less  but it still has a place in my heart	Pretty friggen awesome	Best photo sharing site ever	Ive tried just about every desktop app for Twitter and this is by far my favorite	Vimeo is the YouTube for respectful  creative  serious users  Love it

83145	Its a great IM client but it needs a light version so it doesnt consume CPU  Also  with some accounts  they then to have connection fails	As much as I like playing Mafia Wars  that pretty much sums it up  That was funny		
15873	I use the Tweetie application for my iPhone   quick  light and easy		
9428	Like Firefox but using Chrome 95% of the time now because its so much faster		
14548	The extendability of Firefox makes it the only way to browse	Hands down  the best Twitter app on the iPhone  Full featured

14515	Super fast and good on memory  but until it gets extensions Im a firefox user		
14516	My favourite free twitter app for iPhone/iPod touch  Easy to use and simple design	ridiculously addictive  real time gossip machine!	Theres just nothing else you can compare it too! Runs beautifully  looks brilliant  I just have nothing bad to say!	Good looking  easy to use and has everything at a glance  Easily the best Twitter app for Mac	Gives great recommendations and provides a clean looking library to see what youve *really* been listening too

10160	I used to use this a lot but Firefox just hits all the right buttons for me	Lots of storage  great functionality! Needs a facelift though	Simply the best phone i have ever had	Looks great  i saw the Google Wave presentation and it will definately change the way we do things	Fantastic! I use many Google apps	A poor mans Photoshop  I use it al the time :)		
10163	Firefox  with all those addons  is so damn cool  Its the Gmail of browsers: before Firefox we were living the stone age of web browsing	Very simple  very nice  I cant tweet without it  Brings out that old ICQ nostalgia  Perfect for Twitter begginers

87527	Excellent product  If you have some irreplaceable photos and documents  Dropbox will keep them safe   and save all your revisions for 30 days!	I love the openess of Android   but it seriously needs an iTunes like media manager  I miss iTunes U from my iPhone alot too	Love having a social app in my gmail   but it needs a few more features and tweaks for me to love it	Google Reader is awesome    especially now that it has 2 way commenting via buzz		
31088	Ease of use and a clean interface make it a favorite with me!	Initially  Google Buzz is devoid of all the nonsense that has become a mainstay in twitter  I think the convos and topics are a lot more informative		
84496	I like it so far  HUGE potential  so plenty of room to Love it! in the future	THE e mail service to use	Twitter is the best social networking tool at the moment		
83164	I can no longer imagine a world where there is no Google =D

82663	I am always telling other about Skype! Everyone in my house has their own account! If you use paypal though  only 1 paypal account per skype account	Hulu has replaced cable and satellite in my house  but Im all about saving so we will see how long this free network remains just that!		
30660	Awesome  open  no closed app store that is subjective	With time  this could replace email  but it needs time to mature and have a developer community grow before it gains widespread adoption  Best for collaboration	Google Chrome is great! With a larger developer community and a better extension API  this could really take off  By far  one of the best web browsers around!	Really nice interface  clean and awesome real time  But I like FriendFeed better since I can post to Twitter from it and keep all my stuff in one place!	I like it  but I like the FriendFeed layout better   No ads  slick interface and better realtime  Facebooks good because so many people use it	Looks great  no ads! It is so streamlined and lets me keep everything in one place  instead of a dozen!

8140	Works fantastically  very polished player  but the number of movies is limited and the search is pretty awful	I really like the idea and the website works relatively well  but it is cluttered and was a little frustrating to get going	Very cool aggregator of online media   I wish there was a search for a given show/movie across sources	Very cool application   I see it becoming more useful as technologies converge over the next decade	Whoops  got a few NSFW pages while killing time between coding stints

9481	Best web based email solution hands down!	I miss all Firefox extensions	Rediscovered Last fm again and this time I am not going away :)	I used to love Opera  but their support for Ajaxy websites like Google docs  Google Reader made me switch to Firefox	Great IM client  I love how it integrates everything I care about in one small window  Interface is really minimalistic and thats the way I like it	Sometimes I find myself reading Wikipedia for hours	New user here  I love the idea and websites interface  Good job!	Great way to see alternatives to applications you use day in and day out	Good email client  but I still prefer Gmail	I like their interface  but I wish they support RSS for books in my shelf  Their community features could also use some tuning  Its still a great website thou!	I like their drag and drop support	I am happy with Evernote  but I wish it allowed me to organize my notes better	I am still exploring it  but I like what I see	FIrefoxs greatest feature is its extensions  I do wish it was a little snappier and used a little less resources	I like application and advertising  platforms	Best RSS reader out there  I love their mobile interface	Decent website  but their interface really needs a makeover	I like it (specially the HD option)  but I am not an avid user

90297	Its a great way to communicate with SHORT messages to a vast audience		
37260	hmm still waiting for an invite		
8165	I like how it uses less flash than pandora  It seems like it gives me more control  The user interface could use a few changes  though	Overall  its probably the best browser available  I love how easy it is to add extensions  And it works great on Linux!	A great example of the potential of open source software  Powerful yet pretty easy to use	I still prefer Firefox  and Im waiting for Linux support  but its OK  Each tab and plug in as its own process is a great idea as processors get more cores	Simple  well organized bittorrent client  I use it on Ubuntu	The webmail interface is great  but I use my own email client (Evolution) since you can  Free IMAP support is awesome!

75651	lm like twetter coz lm new join in twetter please help me? key?		
40934	great resource for startups		
40933	Google Chrome rocks! When Chrome is multiplatform  it shall rise and take over from every other browser!	I love Google! I use it daily to surf around the internets		
66706	I appreciate Twitter for its brevity; I long for better stream management capabilities in the web client  Looking forward to experimenting with lists	I like the connections I make; I hate the bevy of quizzes I have to wade through		
40925	Best way I know to both contribute to and watch the conversations on the web		
50363	Tweetie on mac & iPhone   simples :)		
84598	Just one simple question What are you doing? and I am still answering that question with joy and fun		
76973	undeniably  one of the best blogs on social media! Im a daily reader!		
88954	I think you tube is hott!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!		
40929	TweetDeck rocks   Its flexible  customizable  helps you organize the tweets you follow  and it happens to be beautiful and cross platform		
76975	I just love Evernote its fantastic  Simple to use  work perfect in my Iphone   Eduardo Ovies		
8217	Superior to IE  Safari is still tops for Mac and I prefer Google Chrome for the PC  Firefox has fun Apps though		
8218	The whole microblogging thing has gotten overblown; but this was the original service and inspired many great startups  Ingenuous idea  too!	Well the community could use some work  but when youre the most popular video service on the web youre bound to attract some kids  Great video sharing service	Great messenger  if not a little limited by its protocol usage	Love it for its social features  but still cant give up its older brother	A great way to blog!	Absolutely  hands down  the greatest email service in existence  And its not even commercial (yet)!	Would be my favorite messenger if not for its horrid memory usage  Good  but not great	My favorite when it comes to news    Digg is nice too  but nothing beats reddits community! ;)	Favorite torrenting application  supported by a wide variety of trackers  very fast and efficient    Invaluable for file sharing!	Great way to broadcast pretty much anything	Well I like Google and all    but the browser is in its infancy as of yet  When it matures a bit more  perhaps it will make me switch from Firefox!	The best way to keep track of my listening habits  Invaluable!	My favorite web browser  without a doubt  A bit over rated for its extensions  and not as fast as Opera  but I love it all the same	After all these years  still the leader when it comes to finding what you want		
54729	What needs to be said about Firefox? If you use it  you know why its great  If not  you dont know what youre missing	Definitely my favorite torrent program  Lightweight and stable!	Windows 7 = Like Vista  but better  Love the new taskbar!	Ubuntu gives me that warm  Im not a slave to big corporations feel every time it boots up  I like the interface  and its simplicity	I made the change to Gmail a few years ago  and havent looked back once  The interface  the amount of storage   its great!		
38614	very interesting and keeps u updated in real time		
48890	myspace is like da coolest web site like no one hates it in my whole life one preson has told me myspace was wack		
13336	Love my Android phone  could not love it any more unless it brought me breakfast in bed  And to iPhone fanboys I have one thing to say: concurrent processes	Easiest and most flexible blog platform   bar none		
15999	But Chrome is better  IMO	Fast  fast  fast  fast  fast  faaaaaast  I use it and I like it  When adds comes out  It will pwn Firefox so bad		
47559	I love it  but I need to use it like any normal person do   limit friends to close friends and family and do my networking in groups and pages	Eloquence in 140 characters  lots of noise too  you just need to have a little care with the people you choose to follow back	Its almost like Google has a hand in every app I use these days  Email  browser  docs  maps  FBs not far behind  These guys want to rule the internets		
73009	I really like Google Readers simplicity   just wish there was a better mobile version	Still the best news source for web2 0 news		
73006	*sigh* i cant believe imeem is gone   i had so many favorite playlists		
10270	Evernote is amazing and the free edition is a steal! It can be a light CRM  a brain dump  a GTD tool  a project document collection and much more		
48885	Its kool but sumXs u get bored:=]]		
8236	The most usefull social network		
62356	prolly zi best    but big and scary		
75663	i like and new come to join Twitter		
66719	but I have always problems with updates (themes and plugins stop working)  Is this an eternal BETA process? WTH!		
22250	Testing out Blippr   hope this works	Its making my life a lot easier		
87656	Greatest blog on the net!	a better tool than twitter		
34244	After of 32 000 rankings of over 3 000 titles I am still addicted  Damn I love this site		
88987	who could live without it? only thing that sux is that those article writing people think they are the masters of language  and who is not sux	maps is enough  never needed earth	best browser on the market so far  megafast  newest html4 technology in it  Flash Support  comes right with windows :) ROFLMAO just kiddin	If youre in it  you wont want out	my first twitter client  needsupdates!	lot of potential  lot of lag  lot of not everyone uses it so i wont too	by far the best E Mail Service		
15964	I really love it  When i have some issue  They always give me good solution		
10277	Until 2 days ago I used it without question  Now  after a load of crashes  Im looking elsewhere	Its what Im using now  but theres definitely some awkward niggly issues that need ironing out before I commit to it		
43196	Gmail has changed the worled arounf  remember the days when yahoo was giving just 5 mb http://www umeedastrology com		
10276	ideal to share docs between multiple pc/macs and users	a true cool and incredibly usefull application  especially if u use a PC next to your MB		
88983	Tiger Woods ve http://organizebrnckvvtmllttrhaberi blogspot com/ birarada		
14636	Easy to use  Great for posting links to media and stealing stuff off others  See my own page  for instance  (Cool layout   but nicked from someone else)		
38605	I really like firefox  it works really well  has a ton of cool apps like firebug and is really customizable		
10280	I adore Last fm  I really do  Now  if I could figure out a way to get it to scrobble songs from Pandora  Id be set	I love Pandora  Adore it  Its sad that it doesnt seem to work outside the US anymore  because it is awesome	Its easy to use  and works with Last fm	Well  if I didnt like it  I wouldnt be here  right?	I dont use it as much as I use FF  but I havent ever had any major problems with it	It can be extremely useful  but I honestly dont use it very much  I wish it were used on more sites	Used to love it  but with all the changes  Im liking it less and less	Probably the biggest site for videos  but its becoming harder and harder to find videos that havent been taken down for one reason or another	Microblogging in video form! I dont use it as often as Id like  because the lighting in here isnt that great at night  and I dont have a camera when Im out	I was on this site a lot before  but I dont remember why I stopped  (Changed computers  maybe?) It was fun to use and interesting  Try it yourself!	Ive been on a lot of blogging platforms for the long term  and tried even more  Xanga is different because it rocks the community aspect more than the others	I use TweetDeck for my main account  but I still swear by Twhirl for the ability to access more than one Twitter account at once  (Plus Seesmic!)	Seems to have changed quite a bit since it hit mainstream and everyone jumped the bandwagon  but change doesnt have to be bad  does it? Ill wait and see

96596	Ive used Mashable for Social Media research and it is INVALUABLE!		
34230	Voting on movies is a no brainer  Already addicted and struggle to pull myself away  Cant imagine when the site is enhanced and more movies are added		
26626	Simple  to the point  put your ideas out there and listen to others  If you have good content  people follow you  Simple  until @oprah showed up that is	Web 2 0 is still a vast tundra of possibilities in so many ways and while we are all still figuring it out  Mashable is happily our personal Tenzing Norgay	Simple API  inexpensive and all you really need  Tried Twitteriffic too  but this ended up being my ultimate go to for managing four twitter accounts on the go	I used to love it  until all the send me this and super throw that started  Now it just seems like more games and ads than anything else		
87649	Lots of good features

Really easy to use and having fun with this blogging		
30786	Its so relevant to the new economy;a real must for savvy marketers & advertisers promoting products  services  and thought streams		
48062	Currently really neat in my opinion	Its pretty good  Paving the way for more TV to end up on the Internet where it belongs  =)	Been using Firefox for about four years  Love it and the competition its encouraged in the browser world		
30788	Love that columns sync between this & desktop over air; wish sync kept track of whats been read though  Anyone figure out a way to do this?		
67158	No black background! It comes on too hard  Seesmic is mild and nice

55171	Very useful tool both for computer and mobile use		
76093	Great interface  Great functionality	Best alternative to Photoshop		
36075	Awesome way to find new artists  Just a shame the play on demand isnt as simple and comprehensive as spotify	One day ALL communication will be in 140 or 160 character bites ; ) Like many social apps it can take a short time to get it!		
8262	Like YouTube    but without the 12 year old girl lip syncing Justin Timberlake  Instead  think artists  film makers  and just plain cool people

81441	I love the new software stack  and it feels more real worldly   finally a MS OS I can sink my teeth into!	Internet Explorer has come a long way and since MS continues to dominate the OS market  its something we need to keep in mind  Not such a necessary evil anymor

42740	Best music app ever	So far the best twitter app		
92125	I have to find out  This is the first time I see it  So   still unclear www flamingoservicesbonaire colm		
41411	Dont know the reason but I love using this OS		
37397	Cant pass a day without checking it and sometimes spend hours		
37399	Its good for keeping up to date with close friends  Bad because you get bombarded by stupid applications and people you dont like		
36066	CS 3 ist perfect for designing websites but CS 4 sucks badly! The problem ist that CS 4 does not render the fonts like they will be shown in the browsers! FAIL!		
36065	Glitches with GCal oddly enough and other random bugs  Lacks extensions and bookmark syncing    still use it as default for overall speed  may switch to FF 3 5		
92121	oh my fecking god  best thing ever  i am truely addicted  :)		
42746	Aside from the Orwellian overtones and my inability to ignore the similarities between Google and The Borg  of course   I love Google		
55183	I think its funny that we are allowed 160 characters in this field instead of  140 like  twitter  allows : ) Im kidding  Love twitter!		
41416	When will be available on Facebook  or am I not up to date with this bit of news?		
49370	facebook is amazing and i love it sooo i have a question does anyone know a proxy site???		
30760	Created a group  could not add people  nor could I delete the group  Potential is there  not ready for release		
55187	Used to be my browser of choice  not anymore  On Chrome since it came out	I like orkut a tad better  if only because all my relatives & old friends are there	The fastest  slickest browser to date	The newest kid on the block  Rockstar	Awesomeness  Could use a slicker UI though		
30762	Love the UI  Very clever way to display multiple panels of content   Excellent work TD Team!		
1631	Stats are great  I love em	Great  Maybe Chrome is better but at the moment it doesnt offer me anything worth the hassle of getting used to soemthing new		
36069	Although Im a Firefox user  I like to use Chrome a lot  It really is the fastest browser Ive seen  Its very lightweight and it never gets in your way	Incredibly powerful & useful social networking tool with minimal interface  Trending topics is one of the best ways online to be up to date with news worldwide	I wish they didnt do the native look for Windows  I used to use Safari specifically to escape Windows  and now it just looks like a native application  Shame	Google is the heart of the internet	Mozilla based  fast  functional with the best built in RSS reader Ive seen so far  Very well integrated social networking and media browsing	Browser of choice  Faster than ever  it is the best choice for those who like to use a tailor made browser  Abundance of add ons make sure its *your* browser

93449	cant not love it    useful    the forum software by the same company is also great: bbpress		
92117	The 10 50 works with most sites  but some of my bookmarklets stopped working		
2980	Just for the concept of collaborative playlists it is a killer app  They know how to make a good interface and collection is growing fast  Then remain the ads	Their recommendation system is so useful and it runs very smoothly

1643	Wonderful service that is a great global communication platform  I use it daily	Great browser! Always my first choice  While 3 5 has fixed a lot of the memory leak issues  they still remain  Still a top notch browser	Good gaming platform that likely demonstrates the future of digital distribution gaming		
30751	Love the interface  Not very stable (crashed 4 time already)  More customization would be nice (bg color  refresh rate)  Good so far  wanting updates soon		
29773	FF iz so damn goooooood!! iloveit!		
48035	Fast and fast is what I want  Wish it could integrate with One Note		
82793	Like it sure  but its ugly and thats no small thing		
30759	Really digging new #Tweetdeck for iPhone/iPod touch  lots of features  Loving the layout		
30756	Its tiny a little hard to read  I first thought I could enlarge columns  Not bad though its useful to perhaps check all my groups quickly  Im mixed		
48030	Mashable is an integral part of my daily news feed	If speed is your thing   its mine   Chrome is the best		
30755	Looks cool and works ok  Crashed once already  not on App Store WiFi yet  Go to desktop Itunes @nonprofitadvice		
8297	Best way to find and discover new websites  Of any given kind  because you can  pretty much  modify it for your own liking	Whatd I do before I had my iPhone? No clue  because now an ordinary phone seems like nothing in comparison  I so love my iPhone and couldnt live without it	Those who founded this site  they are just the best  I just love this site	How can anyone not love Wikipedia? It really is an endless source of knowledge to all things	Best way 2 keep up w/  and get the correct info out of  the famous peoples own mouths  without any gossiping sites twisting everything and get it all incorrect	I always have Twitter on the go  when out and needs the Twitter world to know what Im doing  Rarely  but I can do it	I like it  though it does have an odd look	Im trying this after TweetDeck and Twhirl is definitely better all around  Twhirls much more accesible than TweetDeck will ever get		
73867	yeah  just when im learning how to do this		
96502	The best free email service and more arround!		
37376	It was great having copy and past

96503	Its the Clearest online Voice available all over the world	I am a proffessional and have got a job through it  Congs!	I use it to Market my campaigns and am earning lots of $$$$@http://bi		
8291	Web surfing bliss  Scads of add ons for nearly every purpose  Clean  organized and easy to use  Blows every other browser out of the water	Cleaner than MySpace  All of the options and services and such are a bit daunting  Learning the ins and outs is difficult  considering the help is lackluster		
58231	The more you tweet  the more you want to  Its additive		
73860	looks like twitter is experiencing another systemwide crash    thats a shame (

79176	Useful  fun applications  and able to customize your profile! Love it	Useful and fast to look things up  but not always reliable	Its useful and has many options  but its not customizable  so I prefer Myspace	Able to personalize it  has many options  and great add ons! Love it!

92314	I am a heavy Android user and love its openness as opposed to certain other big tech companies	It is too convenient not to love  especially for Google addicts	The best browser you can find   Fast  clean  dependable	Nothing better than Google as search or as a Tech company	Gmail is the best organizes easiest to use email on the internet   High Storage space  great add ins  and more ideas coming all the time   Why use any other?	I could use a bit more organization like Buzz

33948	I always think about Myspace how one site with wrongs about design  but I see some beautiful profiles and so    people prefer it    where is the fail?	It has all the information of my interests now about social media    and more	I could say that I love it    but I use a few    so few    that I dont have enough words because the experience is minim    I think it required time  many time	It is marvelous    I like the aggregators	I like it  but I dont understand how combines with my other blogs and apps    no yet	I tkink that Posterous is perfect    I can to organize my schedule (times) and for publishing only I need one mail	I love it always    Twitter help me to contact people around the world for talk on any theme    it counts!	Nutshellmail is real useful    tout le temp!	LinkedIn is a good site to store your professional data  but it has 70% of contacts  jobs and groups in USA    is one problem	Twitter is god between the social media

74478	Firefox is the swiss army knife of browsers  It works with any OS  and with Weave I can keep my tabs and everything on any PC too!!	This is the best native Twitter app I have found for Mac  Even the ads are gorgeously presented in the free version  Fantastic		
10492	Great to have a business microblog site  but Blellow needs to somehow integrate with Twitter   Two logins dont make sense for me

35789	One Week Marketing has changed my life  http://tinyurl com/l6288s

34456	I really like flickr	You caught me I am a Mac lover	Die MySpace Die!	I love this app  I just found it today  but I am already addicted  I can keep up with stuff I like easily tweet and keep on rolling	Ok  so who doesnt use Gmail?		
33126	I would not be where I am today without this program  There is nothing more fun than starting a project with a blank Photoshop canvas	Really makes you think differently on how people connect and share information	Hands down the most sexy Twitter client out there!	Pandora is what the Internet should be all about  giving each user exactly what they want	I only use iPhoto but it is a great photo organizer	Keeps my Macs  iPhone  email and photos all organized and in sync	Now I just need to convince my friends that a polished UI/UX is more important than being The Mayor of somewhere	I cant imagine using another CMS for my site  Easy  flexible and beautiful  Perfect for us web designers	Quite possibly the best online disk service ever  Its so seamless I forget that its in the cloud  A must for iPhone users too!	I dont know how I logged into websites before this program  Developers are constantly improving it too!		
2159	I still remember when there were all those search engines  and someone recommended Google to me  Today  who uses anything else?	The best website to check if you need information about a movie or TV show (or want to know what other fans are saying/theorizing about them)		
86459	i like facebook directory	i like google chrome		
78837	Really great information	so far so good   we just launched with wordpress and its been great

64218	its all good another way of communicting		
2172	I prefer Chrome for speed  gears for offline apps and bookmarklets instead of add ons  Simply better and faster	Free  gradients  filters  fonts  filetypes  the list goes on	Will use it for what it offers next to its competitors	Use it nearly everyday for easy grouping of different types of contacts  Retweeting and url shortening is a breeze		
30080	It is the coolest thing ever   brief but effective		
29088	I use Google Maps as my primary GPS  Street View  in particular  is indispensible for providing a preview of an unfamiliar destination		
13505	Really nice browser  Need to be a little light though		
57921	I love the fact that my favorite band in the world follows us the fans   Its a great way to communicate

10479	Twitter is where its at currently  When FB et al  intro new Tweet esque formats like they have  its a strong indicator of success  Search only strengthens it		
65550	A definite upgrade over most instant messaging programs Ive tried	A great  simple tool for data backup and portability	A great looking alternative to google reader	Quick and minimal  Chrome opens up a lot of space on my little laptop	Definitely the dominant social networking site  but it seems that most of the time I spend there nowadays is spent pruning my news feed to block apps	My favorite social networking site by far  All of the people I want to hear about with none of the distractions of facebook	A solid  but not particularly pretty web app for twitter users  Its column layout is definitely appreciable though		
66886	i found this new innovation of my life		
42054	this is the coolest site ever! lovin it!!!		
65556	great music site!		
30071	It would be great if there was a like option  I dont always like to Retweet or reply if I like a post I read		
30073	Great tool! I learned and communicated a ton with it		
30072	Twitter is a really great micro blogging site  They need to catch up to some of the 3rd party developers though  The Twitter homepage is almost obsolete		
33105	I just started using Twitter a few weeks ago and Im hooked  my emails are piling up  my website remains unfinished  maybe I should change the theme to Twitter!		
35767	http://piodalcin wordpress com/ my blog	twitter  makes the verb to tweet legitimate grammar		
35765	It makes it so easy to consolidate all the things I find interesting that I run across out there		
94093	I use it to subscribe to over 300 blogs  webcomics  news sites  what have you! Dont have time to read it all though	Not using it much currently  but its good for all sorts of things	Brilliant plugin for Firefox and Google Chrome! Takes your Google Reader feeds and displays them in a customizable  magazine like fashion	I use it every day to post links and keep in touch with friends	Downloaded the code from wordpress org a while ago and am currently building my personal website with a custom theme  love it!		
34433	haha can u really live without it??		
35764	Lemme check it out and Ill let you know!		
30074	I trust it more than I trust traditional media like newspapers  magazines etc		
77523	I love Gmail! As it is easy to use and also embedded with Many Google Apps at once which enables us to perform a lot while reading mails		
86479	Google always comes up with something new and interesting  And I agree  Google owns the world  Well  at least the digital world		
29093	its only getting better and better		
43380	Its become a part of daily life  Any site that can do that is win	Am mostly just in it for the forums  which are pretty solid		
14841	Awesome app  5 Stars!!!		
13511	great program :)		
85144	Love it still learning to use it	love it  It works great		
77526	Thank you god (Allah)for helping the creators of twitter brining it to us Its a great way to share your thoughts!!!!!!!!!!!!		
10486	Im loving it  To be fair  I havent checked out Plurk  But do I know people using Plurk? Much of the value is the network of users		
13514	Easy  fast and efficient ! Publish your CV online and find it in Google !		
56604	i luv it  its a whole lot of fun!		
13512	A network that is worth your time	The best email service  e g  can you undo sent messages with other email services? well  with Gmail you can!!		
29094	A great way to stay in the know re: what your loved ones are up to    also can be used to hone in on your interests  many experts on Twitter		
86472	i like it     i can find here some i need   tahnks Utube		
91850	llong time not used  but easy and reliable		
43373	its a good site to be look for it		
69921	Not sure I will ever be able to fall in love with a social networking application  but Facebook is certainly the most popular  why? My space to messy?	It is so buggy at the moment and as slow as a zx81 running quake  I want to like it but it has a long way to go yet  and it needs more users to be useful	I only wish they could get a higher reliability but for what it costs it is one of the best applications out there  Could be better but doesnt have to be	Would have chosen love it which I did even have the premium  But there have been some glitches in the stream and artists like Dylan removed from catalog	A very straight forward interface that requires only one key to use the J  Actually the keyboard short cuts are Google standard so easy to remember  Great!	Only gripe is it is getting way to big  partly because of ad ons which is why most of us love it  paradox  Chrome is much leaner and my first browser now	Favourite default browser shame it isnt on Mac yet  t lack ad ons which is a shame for the ads etc  But it is so fast it makes FF look asleep	Tried many CMSs over the year but this beauty does everything I need and does it well  clean simple interface elegant stylish just use it! 8 sites using it	I have it but rarely use it  but it is handy for the odd occasion I need it  For the rest of the time I have a text editor or wordpad	Useful for when the other parts of the web fail such as email major sites etc  keep up to date with stuff including tv shows	Not as hot on it as I was a year ago  Took the premium due to the upload limit  but never used it  Pro lapsed wont be renewing it  Something needs sorting out	Only used it recently and so far so good  not perfect but hell what is  Looking forward to trying a little snow with it though		
90522	likes to talk to de brods		
69928	at the moment we cant use facebook in my country Vietnam		
30068	Twitter is a statistical sample of the worlds brain & thus how we think   dont be a geek on Twitter and say statistical sample; people wont like you! :)		
30067	Twitter is great!  I was to be a Twenius!		
52250	Just a sharp enough learning curve to keep out some idiots   But accessible enough for an idiot like me		
57943	so far its ohk it aint that bad i gess wat eva just get use 2 it lol		
30069	Great example of good  relevant blogging	Its growth will bring eventual dilution of relevance  Will be around forever  but will someday be just that thing you used to do		
30064	Best App For Torrent Dloading		
77554	Safari is the best browser!		
30063	My favourite Twitter app  makes my life easier and less chaotic :D	Twitters fab! It lets me connect to my friends  stay up to date on news and media that interest me and follow my favourite celebs  artists  authors & more!		
77556	Took me a while to figure out what scrobbling is  but I like the idea	Seamless integration with Mac OS X makes this the best sync solution out there	Boring but functional interface  Loads of storage  but doesnt always play nice with clients because of its use of labels instead of folders	Useful backup for when Quicktime doesnt cut it on a mac  Doesnt have the same sort of integration  though	Anytime I dont think I like OS X  I think of Windows and shutter	Really slick looking native Twitter app for the Mac		
34420	Hey Im Linux guy		
35751	makes the world feel smaller		
78887	best search engine		
30065	one day  Twitter will simply destroy the other blogposts		
76226	I Love Twitter com		
57949	muahhhhh sayang zaha		
78889	ahhh   kok gw yg kena marah cih		
10450	I like the idea of it how I can email  chat and tweet all in one window  but it feels 80% done and needs better privacy		
89534	Really like the integration with Google Reader  And since its Google  future APIs might actually work (as opposed to certain other social media APIs)		
11786	The best email app	Google is the best of the best search engine	Any body can try it  effective feed reader	An awesome browser supports Mac	It works better with Iphones	Very cool photo sharing site	I love it cos Very easy to share our thoughts and liked web pages	One of the best Search Engine		
90518	Its one of the best social networking websites Ive ever seen  Its just awesome as the concept of social networking and its linking with email is awesome!!!!		
90517	Twitter appears inestimable!	Always love gmail		
10454	its great  except would like to add more columns & track conversations better like on Tweetie		
70902	New launch from Apps iphone games by mlab emantras com		
34427	Wow! Really cool		
65572	think it do it  thats firefox		
91840	So far You tube is the best For me  proof me otherwise!		
64246	i  want some one stong pastionet an can comprehind like desean or julio		
30051	I love twitter it keeps me updated on information that is important to me!		
97141	just really started		
26803	TONS of information here  its going to take me a long time to even read it all! Mashable is well designed and full of helpful content  A+!		
73195	Probably still lack a rework of the organization (youll have small informal messages with highly polished Waves all together)		
53594	Mashable is the best on the web  Everything in a nutshell	I come across another blogger using internet explorer today Could not believe he was not on firefox  Its brilliant		
34414	I have used firefox  no problems for like 100 years now		
34413	I love Firefox  Its my home browser		
29077	Its getting betterer and betterer all the time		
34412	Works great  Good for publicity for blogs  great for discovering new things  way easier than news sites	Simple  lightweight  super fast  Only thing it needs is Greasemonkey  built in  (i know theres a hack for it  but hey )	Its constantly open  I use it every day  great for designing  art  doodling  and the new screen sharing tool is amazing	Chrome is better for me  but if you want reliability  compatibility  standards compliant  and highly customizable  Firefox is the best choice	Started with Outlook(with Comcast)  then Hotmail  Yahoo! Mail  then I found Gmail  And deleted all my other accounts		
35743	I also love it for its flexability to access my mail from anywhere and archive everything		
78872	Some think Google Buzz could be the next huge social platform	The best torrent app		
89529	i love it itz coolll		
78875	Skitch is great  It only sucks that the UI prevents me from saving an image that is higher than my screen  (The sharing tab is not available then )		
31383	Wordpress is the best CMS Ive ever used!	I love Digg! Its so easy to keep track of my favorite sites   without pissing around with my bookmarks! I also like finding new sites with Digg :D		
77544	yes it is good and useful		
76214	Plays every fucking thing		
30055	table legs monkey beak    i mean  i like it allot		
89527	Your turn to cook tonight? Need Ideas? We are here to help!! King Ranch Casserole  Revenge is a Dish Best    www localsarasota com/pages/Recipes		
31385	Much easier than Yahoo		
10462	Best Internet App Ever!!!		
85167	i like face book but i am not normally used it because in our university bond the facebook		
11792	one of the best creative apps out there definitely a must have for me   each version offers better and better updates	big fan   wish the ui was a little smoother	great concept for storing/sharing/organizing/finding photos but they just dont do enough to try to continue to improve upon the user experience	this is one of the best Twitter crm/cms apps  but instead of coming up with an unecessary feature like ow ly they should consider more third party integration	lifesaver   has all the flexibility of a simple google app	love the extensive sorting features of this very easy to use bookmarking app   one of yahoos best investments	blippr hasnt gotten the recognition it deserves   as user reviews become more important and need for decent app directory grows blippr will flourish	well designed   outdoes kaboodle	digging the copy/paste  but wish the hover bubble was more like hover arrows so you could determine exactly how many characters youre back tracking through	a mainstay twitter app that keeps getting better and better  would love to see more multi user management tools like tasking  notes  etc	ive been a fan since before my school was even allowed access to this digital dynasty that has become synonymous with all things social media	I did see a great post about things to add to the next release  but currently this is a phenomenal browser and I have no idea why youd use anything else	i second simple and great  but also truly appreciate their totally hands off business model which is going to serve as a great case study for social media	who doesnt hate the tacky classifieds look  but I cant deny its helped me find multiple apartments and an amazing deal on a tv	hands down my most important source for social media news		
77548	I host and post several blogs and it is so easy to use  coordinate and add on to	Yes Twitterfon is very nice but I do prefer Tweetie 2		
91836	soo funny !! :)		
44692	Best storage  features  everything  Gmail FTW	The best of blogging  updating  and short messaging	Never had a problem with it  Dont know why all you people are complaining about it	Many  many  many features that are all crammed into one little screen  but slow	Addons distinguish Firefox from everything else  Even Opera and its crappy widgets that are so notoriously hard to update		
11794	the best twitter app for iphone   and ive tried pretty much all of them	great site for all things social media		
10463	Great interface  Great functionality	Lots of music  No more downloading		
11797	One of the most loved tools  I really do not mind paying for a professional account as it is really worth it		
10465	Ultrafast and accurate syncing	Its fast  simple and portable  The 140 character limit is both challenging and relieving  It doesnt take the time commitment of a blog post		
86496	deepak jha delhi		
34416	it is very good to use ubuntu  try it!		
29072	an effective and simple way to keep up with everyone without suffering through talking to them  :)	   i love Google Chrome more  but Opera is my second love!		
47713	too awsome to not mess with for hours		
69941	i love my parents and my friends		
91872	am addicted on this site cuz its so simple & cool at the same time		
6573	Excellent FOSS alternative web browser  Third party addons push it closer to perfection	The perfect torrent client  All the bells and whistles you need  none of the ones you dont  Lightweight and stable	A web browser that aggregates all your various social networking identities into one place for easy reference  Web 2 0 to the max	Webmail that works  finally	An online portal to your social life  Serves no real purpose and results in an overall loss of productivity for humanity  but hey  at least its not myspace		
9601	I love gmail and labs features!		
6575	an excellent music resource	the best photo sharing site out there	make your own station that you can teach		
90545	i love my space n u to tom		
82914	The easiest/best signup process I have ever seen		
10437	Once it grows up a little more  it will kick the crap outta iTunes	Best email service out there  Hands down		
11768	Perfect place to meet old and new friends! :)		
10439	Mashable makes me tingle		
30048	Pros: Currently a high active user base  convenient  connected to many apps  Cons: Hyped  over exaggerated  on its way down		
10438	i like the email and the ability to hide your real name from public profiles	i love it  but i really miss all the firefox add ons that simplify my life	its great for quick facts    not so great for academic research	I like it  but I like twitters format much better		
77576	Wordpress will become a most powerful and popular CMS in future  Its easy but Powerful  So  I love it		
56630	I like twitter and I want to looking some friends!!!!!!!!!		
31375	I love this operating system! Linux is:   open source!   fast   reliable   amazingly flexible   well documented   great for web servers  desktops  etc		
90538	Once I had the time to configure groups to post to  it will be great to be able to filter to them:  its a much better version than that on Facebook		
11761	Now you can broadcast Live video and post pics to IRLConnect com and it shows up at your geo location  super cool!		
10430	So far Im using it a lot    looking forward to seeing where it goes		
11764	Nice work IRL!		
30049	Love it except    Twitter itself is limited and no other application (Tweetdeck  PeopleBrowsr  Flock  etc ) does it all  Still waiting for that killer Tweet app		
34407	I like Linux  but it will be a LONG time before it becomes consumer usable    if ever		
11766	Firefox is thousands miles ahead of IE  Its my favourite browser		
47702	i love everysong come on		
6581	A great start for this site  I can see Blippr really become a helpful source for reviews with a larger user base  I also would like to see more blip types		
42015	whatsup my name is keesha about me cute nice

23750	Amazing micro blogging app!!!		
69959	Its fun to put your city (in my case  Indianapolis) on the map with Gowalla!!!		
82908	Nice integration with other social networks	Very fast  love the simplistic interface and finally for mac too!		
10447	Posting a tweet is like eating Lays Potato Chips  you cant tweet just once :)	Simple & seamless way to keep important files available  Between several desktops at work  a number of computers at home  and now the iPhone  Its a keeper!	With TweetDeck on both the desktop & iPhone it is hands down the most effective client for accessing Twitter	No I have not used Google Wave  but my expectation is high :)	The successor to Mosaic  freed by Netscape with inspiration from ESR  Maintain balance in the browser wars against IE  Thank you deeply  with Love!	Best geo social networks and a great way to stay in touch with friends	Facebook is continues to provide an ecosystem which encourages people to share with friends and family  And they continue to enhance their services!	The reference for email clients  but it is becoming a bit outdated with integrations features in Digsby and Gmail	Amazing! Installed  signed on to my account and my list of contacts pops up  Call my biz partner working in India  W00t!	Mashables is a must read! The Wall Street Journal for Social Media and Web 2 0		
35723	I think it is great! I wish I knew my way around better though  Thank U : )		
52283	Quite better than loads others  Not be the best  though

This rates hirer than LinkedIn as far as functionality goes but LinkedIn is more popular	This would be good but they just havent worked out enough of the problems for me yet	I just found this site thanks to Mashable but I am LOVING IT!	I used this OS for a couple years and never suffered the problems other people did	Good but its kind of a hassle to build upon	Keep track of everything in one place! Great app!	One of the best sites for syncing files and backups  When I had to reinstall Windows 7  this is how I backed up all my files  It is a definite must!	The only web browser I use  They just need to fix the crash issue for me to LOVE IT!	Keep in touch with everyone! And the apps are addictive!	This has been a must for my business! I love it! Get a good headset and its wonderful!

63752	I luv it It is a good social network platform able to connect with the outside world

83341	here for networking & positive friends		
30813	Many people dont understand what this app does at first  but once you figure it out and start using it regularly youll never want to surf the web without it		
13499	Despite its a young CV site  its already one of the best Ive used  Fast  beautiful  but above all very promising since a lot of people already use it !

30804	I really like being able to copy/paste  Also gotta love landscape mode for all native apps  Push notifications are good too but still seem a little glitchy	So far it seems pretty good  Like all first versions there are some glitches  The best part is how it syncs with the desktop version to keep all your groupings		
30803	i use yelp all the time to look up new places to try  on a sidenote  i love that theyve given new life to the previously underutilized word yelp	i didnt like webmail until gmail came along; now i refuse to use anything else  love the threaded conversations and built in chat feature

66800	Ive tried many others  but WP is the best of the fully customizable CMS platforms	The Web developers sweet spot!		
74420	Of the Twitter apps Ive tried  I like this one the most  Great features  Runs great on Mac and on my iPhone	Addictive time suck		
96674	not sure the reward bit is compelling though		
29817	great for syncing small files between work and home  dont try large files though	gmail is great  the only thing i dont like is that you cant sort the columns

Its the browser I use for everyday use  Its about the best for keeping track of all your social networking crap	infinitely customizable  it is the Anti Safari of browsers  But beware  every app you add slows it down just a little bit more until		
9689	Worked well  until my network caught me for illegal downloading   Ah well	Plurk complements Twitter nicely   My favorite features are the Karma system and the timeline	Wikipedia is fun to use   But the information isnt always super accurate	Ive been using Wordpress since November 2nd 2006   Its a great service but with Twitter and the micro blogging craze I think its a little out dated	Delicious is a great service   Having all your bookmarks wherever you go is a must for just about anyone	iTunes is nice   But I personally prefer Songbird	A filesaving system that works flawlessly	Listening right now!

Using safari on a Mac is browsing perfection	Meh   Twitter is better	Tumblr is great a way of posting the things that are just to long for Twitter :)	Remarkably simple concept  very easy to use  and its free!	Everything about Songbird is perfect   I feel sorry for iTunes and its lack of customization	I personally prefer using Tweetie when on my mac   But I love using TweetDeck on my iPod!

I love 12seconds  think of it as Twitter in video form	I might not have 09 yet  but iLife was one of the main reasons I bought my mac in the first place	Very quality app thats great for people that like to tweet breaking news throughout the day!  I definitely recommend it!	My favorite site to use when I feel like discovering awesome new music	Works amazingly any time you have internet access but no tv (OFFICE!)

81749	I use it to find interesting news topics in real time	It has big potential  but it is a year or more from replacing anyones email	More options than you can shake a stick at make Firefox the top choice for developers and power users	The best spam filter  continuous improvements  and no vendor lock in

DAMN MSN!!	Love it!!!!  iPhone has come of age!	Its ok  Wish it was more important  eg i can go without it  i dont need it  i NEED my Flickr / Twitter etc	A bit messy in the design  but without doubt  the best place to store pics on the web! + iPhoto syncage = Ace	I couldnt go without it  But its really beginning to stagnate  Needs more inovation in my book	Love the matt cartoony graphics!

The only downfall is the movie selection  but the previous TV seasons cant be beat   Works beautifully on my Xbox 360	Somehow I never thought I would get into Twitter    now I am a total addict	When I was still using desktop mail apps  I loved this one a lot	The only reason I didnt give it an I love it! is the lack of extension support	Use WP everyday for work and personal blogging  would be lost without it	Ive used several torrent clients  but this is my favorite by far	Use it every day   Sure it has a few quirks  but hard to imagine life without it	Love it   Love being able to see places Ive been and showing them off to others	Days and days of mindless entertainment :D	Love it and run all of my music through it	It would get an I love it! if my friends and contacts outside the USA could use it  otherwise a fantastic site	Use this site constantly for reference   My dream is to be on it someday :D

8425	I can see the appeal  though dont use it much personally	Jump started this whole social aggregation thing that Facebook is now emulating	loving Chrome for its speed and stability   It has become my main browser	One of the simplest image uploaders out there   Has an easy to use API for building image uploading into your own apps	an amazing platform that keeps getting more interesting every day	a loyal users since 2005     keeps getting better : )	Relatively new user  but it has changed the way I use Twitter   Twitter should buy this application and make it their own!

30916	Being a Flash developer  I have nothing bad to say about it  :) Too processor intensive  Thats it  Really	I use it for a long  long time now and I simply cannot switch to anything else  Extensions and Greasemonkey scripts are an irreplaceable combination	Simple  effective and gorgeous  What else would you want?	Offers the best online services and tools that make my life easier	I gotta admit  its addicting and I found quite a few new stuff using it  Needs a gadget section!	Loving it so far  Working with someone and using Dropbox at the same time feels like working in a single room  Great for collaborative works	Combined with OpenOffice  I never opened Microsoft Office ever again and my document management became completely free	Tried every IM and this one suits me the most  Connects to all networks including major social networks and email  Missing some features but nothing crucial	Something between blogger and twitter  Just what I always wanted and needed!

Love the instantly watch feature  very useful for in between DVD shipments  More movies you can watch directly on your computer would be a definite plus	Very pretty and fits right into the aesthetic look Mac has going  Had TweetDeck and twhirl  but Tweetie wins hands down for being the most simple and efficient
