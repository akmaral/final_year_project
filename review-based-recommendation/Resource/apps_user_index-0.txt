Last fm is the daddy of music services  I pay a paltry Â£1 50 per month subscription  Its a bargain I tell thee & being a tight Yorkshireman I love a bargain!

1	High octane geek oriented social news filtering  No nonsense UI  great amounts of content  and more customizable than competing offerings  Love it	1st Jabber client I used  and good enough at what it does  but I dont have a use for it over other multi protocol IM clients  Good app  but not for me anymore	Great little plugin  The external player management is what I first used it for  but providing a inline flash player for any in page MP3s makes it a winner	Everything I want from a torrent client  and nothing I dont  Not much to say beyond that!	Absolutely wonderful  Great content  high res videos  and ads that are short enough to be worth sitting through	Convenience is king  Ive bought more games through Steam than Ive ever bought in a store  and the weekly sales are a huge plus	Mostly useless  but when its useful  its really useful  Collaborative design seems to be its niche	Interesting idea  A definite good first offering  though I think itll need to mature a bit before it can be a serious contender	Not bad  but AIR apps have a tendency to jack up my system  Its a solid app  but Ive dropped it in favor of Digsby  since Im already using it for IM	Great featureset  but feels relatively unpolished and eats up a ton of RAM  I still use it for the time being  but Im shopping for a replacement	A bit of a memory hog at times  but its good enough that I use it as my primary  Does just about everything I want in an email client  and not much else	This + my XBox 360 completely satisfies my TV entertainment needs  Dont have cable anymore  and dont miss it	Great extension  Im really  really digging the multiple rows of tabs  since I tend to have something like 30 open at any given time	Im a big fan  Didnt see what the fuss was about  but once I started using it I was hooked  Love being immersed in the daily buzz	Ill ashamedly admit to never really using finance software before Mint  but Mint made it easy and useful enough that I have no excuse not to	Single handedly changed the way I use webmail  I dont think I could live without it now  Seriously	Hard to beat  IEs a relic of a bygone age by now  but Opera  Safari  and Chrome dont match its customizability via plugins  Im a definite fan	Really great combination of several products  Has some stability and performance problems preventing love it from me  but those will hopefully get worked out		
10667	This is one of the best think on the online solution	much more people use this searchbox		
76495	Great Twitter client app  with tons of functionality   Anything you need to do on Twitter   The only way to go if you have an iPhone

2	A quality service with just the right plug in for my favorite blogging platform  Tumblr	Discovery made simple  O the things Ive stumbled upon since!	Really slick and simple  If only you could say that about most apps	What was life like before Google? Less informed  less simple	Fast  I havent made the switch from FF3 quite yet  but it may someday come  Only time will tell	Nice  but with room for improvement  Given its immediate scale  however  I think people will find this a compelling complement to their social media addictions	The most useful guide to navigate the Social Media landscape  period  (Full disclosure: theyre our parents  so Im biased )	Great Digg alternative  cleaner  simpler	Their most recent redesign is cherry	The mother that birthed a new web generation  Oh yeah  it has nice pictures  too	I dont add videos  but I sure do enjoy watching them	I dont use it all the time  but its a really nice app when I do	Simply the best  Now if Google only made a desktop client that beat Outlook	A very useful FF plug in for the tweeting inclined	If you want the most robust blogging platform  this is it  I prefer Tumblr for simplicitys sake  but I think Wordpress is incredible	A wonderful video site that is a far superior user experience than YouTube  And their commercials rock  too	I dont use it for my regular news  but I do use it as a way to find *some* entertainment news  And typically its good	A dead simple app with the perfect features  A must buy for all iPhone using  Twitter loving geeks	I have a love/hate relationship with Facebook  I really do love the utility it provides  but hate that it demands so much of my time  Curse you  Zuckerberg!	The next big thing? Im not sure  but it does a good job fulfilling its purpose	Simple and effective  And the provider of vlips (video blips)  too!	Google has crushed me yet again with their Tsunami of Awesomeness!	If only I had more time in the day to enjoy this service to the fullest	I love when I have it plugged in  But when I dont  I hate it saying I need to update  Argh!	The anti YouTube if you will  Vimeo is a wonderful example of creativity on the web	Inspiration for blippr  What more need I say?	A great idea  wonderfully executed by an exceptional team	For what it does  it does well  (Side note: this is my first iPhone blip!)	Intuitive for even the analytically challenged	Now that they offer DRM free music  theyre all the better  Im not as much a music lover as a film geek  but I do appreciate iTunes while I work	It gets the job done  but it isnt nearly as good as Picasa  Flickr  or other services I prefer	Its a great idea  and good execution  If only it worked all the time	Absolutely killer  You cant beat its simplicity  or its most wonderful freeness	IE trembles in its wake  As it should		
3	Cmon you dont need me to say anything about Firefox   Use it  Love it  abandon Internet Explorer for all things except updates	By far the most user friendly and flexible email service I have found   Far better than MSN/Yahoo/Any other free email service		
96095	Mega useful when sharing full res photos and videos with mates and you dont want to use Flickr or Facebook		
4	Im still a fan of blogger but I do enjoy WordPress too	I can listen to songs that I havent heard in a long time  NO COMMERCIALS either!	Check it almost everyday and I love how easy it is to find people you havent connected with in years	I really like the fact that Gmail doesnt erase your emails after so many days and youre able to look up past IM conversations  Even better  its FREE!	Great way to stay in touch with friends throughout the day	Personally I dont use YouTube to post videos  but I love watching what other people have posted on there		
35940	The best search engine !	The best just after Firefox !		
5	Good to find out about movies you like  but not a very user friendly interface  Id like it more if the layout was more shiney	The best  most recently accurate source of information on the planet  It should totally be a legitimate source on scholarly research =P	Like all the useful things Ive come across  Steam was introduced to me by my brother  Useful for hopelessly addicted TF2 gamers	Fantastic site  just what every creative mind that uses computer programs needs  My one complaint is that I dont have my own software to record something!	So freaking cool! Download a copy and go explore your planet  Be sure to check out the topography  too  Mount Everest is really hard to find  though	Heck Yeah  I love how the interface gets better every time I log on		
6	Its fun and I trust my friends opinions more than reviewers

10634	Thoroughly enjoyable  but can easily eat away the hours of your day if you give in to it	does everything one could need  Only downside is its use of XHTML which is inappropriate for the vast majority of Web users out there (the ones using IE)		
60932	I have been using Internet Explorer since 1998 and for some reason I downloaded Firefox I am moving all my bookmarks to Firefox its so much better and faster	I love it I stay on it the whole time Im online  You dont have to use the web and have a tab open to keep up with Tweets

5436	As youd expect from Apple  iWork is simpler than Office but just as powerful  Being able to export in DOC and PDF formats makes iWork a viable replacement	Lemmings meets Dizzy Bee  This is an absolute joy to play  and you can either sink hours into it or play for a little while at a time	I liked it so much I paid the Â£12 for a license without ever seeing an advert  The UI is stunning  and showing @replies and DMs as threads is a great idea	Such a simple site  but potentially a really useful one  Its great being able to find people with similar interests  and its easy to add yourself to the list	Twitter is a friendly community  a useful tool  and a great way to stay in touch  But a word of warning: its very addictive  Wave goodbye to your productivity!	This is a really useful app  Ive been using Shazam for years on my phone  In the UK  you can dial 2580 and Shazam will text you the tag	More space and better features than its competitors and  at the moment  the only Webmail service you can access offline  I wouldnt use anything else	Now YouTube supports HD videos and downloading  Vimeo has lost its unique selling points  Uploading is much faster and simpler  though	Its a solid operating system and proves Linux doesnt have to be complicated  If I ever get another PC  Ill be running Ubuntu on it for sure	The new version should make blippr a real contender in the social networking market  Tell your friends: lets make blippr the next big thing!	Thought Id try it now theyve finally de uglied it  seeing as Tweetsville has been all but abandoned  Great app  I love replying straight from the timeline	Suffers from an algorithm that favours power users submissions (and funny pictures from 4chan)  but Digg is still a great way to get your daily dose of news	Interface is clunky and non native  but the service has pretty much all the music you could ever need & the playlist sharing works well  Adverts are infrequent	I visit occasionally but I dont enjoy it as much as Digg  Reddit is too open and instant  Digg relies too much on the algorithm  Theres still no happy medium	Its recommendations arent brilliant  but its a great way to find people with similar music tastes to yours	It finally arrived! New Challenge and Two Player modes are awesome  150+ free tracks to download  The new look is great  too  Tapulous continues to amaze me	I dont have an aerial socket in my room  so I use Zattoo a lot  Streaming is generally very stable and quality is decent  New channels are added regularly	Mac OS X isnt as perfect as everyone likes to make out  but its the best OS Ive used so far  Now Ive gone Mac  Im not going back	I was surprised to see that Alexa ranks Yahoo! above Google  Mail  Answers  and Flickr are great  but Yahoo! Search sucks compared to Google	With a Pro account  Flickr is a useful tool and a great way of sharing your pictures  Its just a shame its so badly crippled if youre not willing to pay up	Definitely a powerful tool for bloggers and Web designers alike  but be prepared for one heck of a learning curve if you want to make your own themes	Feature filled  and the only software I would dream of using for organising my music and syncing my iPod  Sadly  its rapid growth has made it slightly slow	Its Last fm for software  Tracking works well  but recommendations need to be more intelligent (e g   I obviously dont need Hotmail if Im using Gmail)	Google Maps is a tool  Google Earth is a toy  I like zooming around the globe  but I honestly cant find a real use for it	Makes it really easy to get your pictures on Twitter  and it integrates with clients like Tweetie  It keeps a full size version of pictures too  which is nice	I used to use uTorrent  but then I found Transmission which is a cleaner  simpler  more customisable alternative  Also regularly updated  so its very reliable	Congratulations! Your iPod touch is now an iPhone Wi Fi  Its very easy to set up your profile if you dont already have one  and audio quality seems very good	Unlike most people  I didnt have a single problem with Vista for the entire time I used it  I prefer Mac OS X  but Vista is still a nice OS to use	If youve only ever used Internet Explorer  you dont know what youre missing  Firefox makes Web browsing easier  more secure  and ultimately more enjoyable	I use iTunes for organising my music and videos  but if Im just playing something I use VLC  Simple but powerful app		
5437	Address bar=Search bar is really an awesome idea Love the tabs Huge space browser for Light and speed	Quite better than Vista  Somehow user friendly compared to Vista  The UI also changed more to classy and elegance look  Love the bootscreen & welcome screen	My 2nd choice  :) However  great help when comes to maintain ratios when download through private tracker	The best music streaming service  Fast  slick & less cluttered design  Very user friendly  Wide variety of collections	Sharing files became easier with Dropbox especially when comes to huge files  Easy to setup  friendly user  awesome upload speed & download speed		
55503	Chrome user since day 1 and I love it

12424	A great Adobe AIR application for all those twitter wh*res out there!		
64472	its good and runs faster than all the other browsers but IE8 wins on its user friendly interface  Plus the new Msn toolbar seals the deal with windows live

5461	It was the RSS feeds of my Blips that drew me here and I grew to love the simplicity and improvements   I would love to see product reviews (i e  electronics)	The price is steep  but it must be worth it; with so many commercial and free alternatives  and after Ive switched to Linux  I still use it in a Windows VM	Ive recently made the switch and it does everything I used Windows for  a few things better  I wouldnt yet recommend any *nix OS to casual users though

49669	pretty cool   i geuss		
8545	Really great and useful  You should check this out	I just found it and its really cool  You take a picture on your phone and email it to Posterous and its uploaded to your website	Great  I even found a promo code on Daring Fireball (the promo code is DARINGFIREBALL)	I loved it since it was just a simple jailbroken app  Ive watched my baby grow up	I was a little late to start useing this but once I did I couldnt stop!	A must add to your RSS reader	Really awesome  Its as good as BlogTV	I dont like the community at all  The only reason that this is staying at a like is because some people make good videos (*some* people)	Its ok  I wish it had a better way to get on the front page	Its good but Im getting a Mac soon	Flickr is a great way to share photos online  Probably the best that Ive seen yet	Really useful  And fun too!	I use Mobile Me to keep everything connected  But I see why people like gmail	Its has an iPhone  online  Windows  and Mac client  It keeps you organized everywhere	Really good app  But Im not a big Skype person	Yes! Just yes	I didnt like it to much when I tried it  I might try it again	There are some downsides (like being slow)  But its made for the iPhone and iPod   you cant beat it	Twitter is THE BEST SOCIAL NETWORK on the internet! Follow me on Twitter @ChrisWMartin	Works well but theres not many times that I need to use it	Ive used Chrome  Its pretty cool but (In my opinion) Its not the best browser out there	For some reason I dont like it very much  I prefer Twitter and Friendfeed  I know a lot of people that love it so Ill keep it at a I like it	Twitpic is a really easy to use  And its Twitters most popular client  I love it	I really love it  Just try it out	I simple and good idea kepted simple (which supriseingly dosent happen often)  I really like TinyChat!

(Pingle is a great iPhone Ping fm client)	I love GreaseMonkey! Very useful!	Great browser! But     I would say Safari beats it	Best bookmarking site  You can access your bookmarks anywhere  I use it every day and have over 70 bookmarks!	I had it ever since it was a jailbroken app  Its great but the only downside is the music	Its ok  but for my current background Im using the old school Photoshop method	Not my kind of thing but its good	Not the best  Dare I say overrated?	By far the BEST Twitter iPhone app and the updates keep makeing it better  Ps  Im glad to see some iPhone apps on here	Last fm is better  But Pandora would be in 2nd place:	An OK browser but Firefox and Chrome are better	Its fun  Im not sure how its very useful  But its fun

35029	best browser based game	Hope they release it really soon		
35028	Best interface for Flash video  but the T&C scare me slightly	Good: theres nothing comparable in power or usability  Bad: the UI is so bad theres a whole website dedicated to Adobe UI Gripes <adobegripes tumblr com>	Indispensable  although the UI feels a little clunky for some reason	The ultimate in browser simplicity  On Windows there is nothing better  Pretty fast too	I cant wait  Apart from anything else  kill the subject line! This really is the future of email	IMAP  great UI  fast  conversations	A very different workflow to Windows and Ubuntu  but everything is so much simpler and theres no messing around in the system if you dont want to  Also  BSD	Pure Mac simplicity  A bit crap on Windows  but on OS X theres nothing better	Who knew 140 characters could be such an important addition to my life? You just cant understand it until you use it		
35026	Looking forward to Snow Leopard :)	It gets the job done  I cant wait until we do most of what Flash does nativly in the browser	Great for web development because of the powerful plugins	Clean and elegant  my browser of choice	Best Twitter app for the iPhone

8554	Simply  the definitive email	A mastodon and heavy browser  but yes  there is the best and most complete		
37673	I dont see the point  but  hey  everyone else is using it  A bit like Facebook  only less time consuming		
8555	nice  but be careful in using it	fast  easy  give it half a year extra for the noobs

15401	What I use day in day out   A great microblogging tool  and it can get addictive! D:	Probably the best operating system I have ever used  and Im comparing it to Windows 2000!  Highly recommended  but dont impulse upgrade if you have Tiger 10 4	Using this on both OS   Great ap that always notifys you if something interesting happening in the network		
85310	He probado varias plataformas de Blogging  pero ninguna me convence  Por su facilidad y por su configurabilidad  me sigo quedando con Blogger	Me encanta Reddit  lo encuentro muy superior a otros servicios similares como Digg  porque es mucho mas configurable		
11049	Can imagine life without it anymore		
37679	I dont expect to have to pay someday for all my great Google tools  They are not Microsoft  They are funded by their carefully placed ads  Good for G and me		
36348	Seesmic  seems more stable than Tweetdeck  Let me clarify   more stable on my linuxbox	Good but I have to tweak it massively on my eeepc 701  I use it on my desktop  still deciding between Tweetdeck and Seesmic for dominance on my pc	Looking forward to using this app  on my G1  I just signed up for an invitation today	Love Ubuntu  I have used Ubuntu since 5 04  It is very easy to perform administrative tasks on  The beauty of Ubuntu though is its community		
11048	This is great  Ill look for you on Twitter  Jennifer!		
82283	Somehow I lost the music in my 30s and now its back with a vengeance  Spotify is superb!

Just recently got into this site and like it so far  Loving it will take some time  Lets see in 6 months what i say then	If it was not for the memory hog bizness I would love Firefox  Unforrtunately b/c of this I had to switch to Chrome which is more memory hog unfriendly :)	The best home for all things social networking!

263	Id pay the sub $5 for tweetie (and Id pay it monthly if needed)  Its great and recommended		
85308	Totally cool site   i love the deals		
35006	Great service to discover new websites  One big downside: You can not share your favorites easily		
86635	I truly tried to use Wave  but the problem is that I  just like many others  do not really get the idea behind it   GOOGLE  needs to further develop it		
37664	Best RSS reader available  even superior to any desktop application that attempts the same thing	Underrated  Great mobile OS  and open source too	Always fast  even though its funded by donations  Great source of info	Fast  renders webpages great  Too bad its so unstable on Linux	More space than I would ever need  fast  works great  and has great add ons as well

12350	while I was an early adopter of myspace  I found that from a usability POV Facebook was better  From a customisation stance  I still prefer Myspace		
72012	Google wave allows for instant viewing and use of items not available in IM (documents  charts etc )  The concept is awesome  and its not there yet  but soon	Whatever they did with Wordpress  the did it right  Other Blog services should mimic this platform as much as possible

60035	i  like talkin 2 ma dorkz n it awesome		
16712	Spotify is fantastic   am amazed that some people havent heard about it or assume its illegal  Play free  streamed music  huge library	Surely the best iPhone Twitter app   easy to use and really straightforward to flick between accounts		
11023	Max Engel  the 8 bit Kid  is bringing MySpace back   just yall watch		
13687	Great resource  quick and easy way to look up almost anything		
11026	Going from Chrome to IE  or even Firefox  is like trading in a Porche for a Pinto   Google Chrome ROCKS

Love the ease of it and good to update your status and let your friends know	This is one of my main sources of social media news  It is updated very often and is very resourceful	A nice simple URL shortner with analytics	The best blogging platform there is  Easy for learners and you can edit it as much as you like  Also you can connect to your blog via email and apps	A brilliant way to listen to music  It is free  quality is brilliant and all the songs you need are on there	The best mail service out there  It is very fast and secure  Simple to use and is hassle free  Only problem is there is a lot of spam but it does get caught	It is now my default broswer  As many other Google products it is simple and easy to use  The bookmark sync feature is awesome	An awesome site to check out videos  Also useful for education sometimes  Failblog channel is my personal favourite	Very easy to blog  Simple and is fast  All you do is use your email and post	Brilliant online storage  Easy to use and best of it is free  2GB is more than enough for storing documents online	Nothing to say except Google it! Best thing on the web!	Best paid twitter app there is! Nice UI and there are no faults for me	A must have tool for your computer  It cleans up a lot of junk at the same time		
1948	It is really hard to find anything decent on it  the lack of real programming also hurts it  Can still be fun  but just difficult to find it	I have to admit  this is a really nice tool for twitter  though most useful if you follow too many people and twit too much	It is a really easy app for blogging  The plug ins allow for more powerful tools  though they often go neglected	I love it  thinking of getting a text plan just so I can twit on the go	I dont use it much for storing photos  but for finding good photos  it is a gem  However  the search isnt great	Has a lot of potential  but needs add ins at the very least  even then it is just getting close to Firefox	It is very fun to play with  and very cool for a map program as well  I like finding new places with it	It is good for what is there  but choice for TV is limited  even if they have a show they only show 3 or 4 at a time	Easily the best overall browser  no longer king of speed  but the extensions are still what make the difference over Chrome	tons of space  great clean interface  I prefer this over software mail now!	For what it is  I think it is the best of its kind  I personally dont like these types of things though		
85321	Clean UI and great extensability  Publishing and organising is a lot of fun  Pro account is cheap and worth it  Free account is very limited	I mainly use it for the stats  and I fucking love stats  Stats  man! Its also pretty great to find and keep track of events

12365	allows me to organize twitter! create groups  search and integrate Facebook  love it!		
38977	love it  dont love Facebook		
86650	Recent newbie  starting to get drawn into the big black time eating hole they call Tweeting		
12368	This is basically the only email I actually like to use  All other webmail should be this easy and intuitive	Steeped in self importance (like all social sites really)  but is good because its short (like this site)  so it works with my ADD		
38979	Im almost quitting my conventional weblog  Twit is faster and easier :)		
8595	Seamless integration between Amazon S3 and OS  Automatic backup is really useful  Would love it if it could edit ACL		
61384	i love some one    i need he for life		
74699	Simply the definition of speed when browsing the web  still needs some work on the extension API like it needs the ability to stop elements from loading at all	Fast became an essential way to keep in touch with my friends  plus play some fun games  But I trust Zuckerberg about as far as I could throw this planet	Simple fast with stunning uptime  gmail is the definition of a system that just works	An excellent Twitter App only let down by the fact it runs on the AiR platform which is terrible	An incredible idea but still a long way from people understanding its true potential I feel  perhaps when the APIs are more fleshed out	Simple and blindingly fast that takes full advantage of the hardware I give it  Exactly what an OS should be	Almost overnight became an absolutely essential communication and news tool  hope they find a revenue model soon	A simple well though out system only marred by a couple of rather large compatibility bugs and a few problems with the auto fill system picking the wrong movie	A superbly simple way to keep yourself up to date on all your sites news and articles  the best reader I have ever used	It was a superb idea while it lasted but since the CBS buyout development has ground to a halt and I dont see the service being around much longer		
97335	too nice   its even getting addictive		
74694	Gotta love the connectivity potential	By far the BEST browser out there today  though Chrome is fast encroaching  Ive found Firefox to become somewhat bloated and slow due to addon instability	I love the social take on music; I enjoy sharing my track history and listening to tunes in my Library	The best email app ever; nothing else stands up  Period	Great resource for trading information in any niche community; though the aspect of insignificant chatter from many users can annoy me	Love WP and have for several years  Think Ill be loving it for many more years to come	THE source of info on the net  period  Some may question its accuracy since anyone can edit  but they arent clear on the sites edit policies and QA protocol	Lots of potential  and lots of work to go before this is something Ill love  I look forward to the day I can love it		
59068	tell people twitter and they listen even MPs Its Awesome!!		
53763	Great wish I could get on my iPhone  damn apple I have loved them for years but now they have grown more into pop culture they now have a big ego for problem		
37632	After over a month Im still using the free version of Twitterfon  Its quick and stable  does everything I need  and the ads arent intrusive  Why pay more?	Never used the previous versions  but 3 0 does more than I ever though a phone could do  With th right apps  the features like the compass become essential		
11003	The best OS right now in the world	The only issue is they write too many articles a day  which it makes a RSS no so attractive		
77736	it just works! they do have awful user agreements if you happen to have read them  but who doesnt?! let us hope they will never be abused		
38965	First twitter!  Not sure its worthwhile!!!!

(What the hell was that song again???)	Its good    Not enough people I know use it    Then it would be a love!	Expensive but has the most awesome feature set EVER!	FREE TRACKS YAY!	Flickr  where to start    Much more social than google images  but sometimes has less relevant results   This is better for a laugh or personal pictures	Blippr was a stroke of genius    Thank you Mashable!	For twitter  it is the top  but unfortunately  as in my many other reviews  im not a big twitter person	Much better than all of the competitors out there	Garageband makes it for me  though I like Imovie as well	Its ok  but blogging isnt really my thing	I think that xmarks has better built in functionality	Its good  not as good as windows 7  not even close	But im not an adult  so I dont have to worry about finances :D	I love it    Except for the fact that the other people who use it see someone using windows    USE UBUNTU  ITS BETTER lol    I dont like that	Loved it  that is til mom made me delete it	Blippr is better  cus it has everything	This is awesome    spotlight but 1000000% better	Well     Not as good as Firefox or Chrome  but better than safari and IE	Good for finding local restraunts!	An 87    SERIOUSLY!! THEE best time waster  lol site  and beyond in existence	Fine for random facts	Are You People Joking?  Its the most amazing thing ever?	GREEN BIRDY!! YOU ROCK! If only you spread your wings and allowed for email and social networking like my beloved Digsby	Its a great app  but again  Ill reemphasize that Im not a big twitter person	For chat only though  adium and digsby are better	Digsby  Ya dig? Awesome    chat  mail  facebook     Incredible    If only it was as customizable as adium  which doesnt have to focus on mail and facebook	Never was into feeds untill I tried this   It keeps me interested during spare time and during work  like my own personal magazine!	Nice    Still think Office is better   This is about the same price	Windows media player begone!	Search  docs  Chrome  Android  Maps  earth     Awesome	Ok  so you just blipped the dang thing itself    How can you NOT give the I Love It! You cant even blip it without IT        Weirdos	LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!

Meh    Youtube is better  but for live tv (which isnt that important to me) this owns	Wikipedia  you look up something simple  get diverted by a link in it     hours later you ask yourself  What was I looking up again? I LOVE YOU WIKIPEDIA!	Ok    ive said this enough    If you want to know what i mean  look at my previous stuff about twitter	YAY no switching windows!	Its a good idea  just a bit poorly executed    If they integrated it into the facebook status or twitter  then itd be a love	While good  it doesnt not compare to acrobat com and zoho		
8679	FriendFeed is the greatest thing on Earth!		
11178	Twitter completes me :)		
36459	Good one   but soon its gonna be Snow Leopard!		
8695	Mashable has been a great source of info  I am glad Leo had him on TWIT	Still getting used to the new design but have really enjoyed reconnecting with old friends	I am glad Twitter has really taken off  I find myself spending more and more time on it	I really like the lightweight feel  Dont miss IE for a second	Cool site  I think it could turn into a great resource if enough people contribute		
45	Kinda sad  I hardly even scan the actual news for headlines anymore since my friends status updates keep me in the loop  Its a great way to stay connected	Its fun  super easy to use  and a little bit addicting  sort of like how Facebook is a little bit addicting	Does anyone even use that Other Browser anymore? I love the plugins  switching between tabs by keyboard shortcut  and I love that it saves my tabs when I exit!

78446	Im still exploring blippr  There are various of application here	I can use the Google translator! Awesome!		
54478	Needs work  other services like vimeo are much more superior  But youtube works	Playlisting need help    other than that nothing is wrong  There is a reason vlc is the only media player I ever use		
33531	I love stumbleupon! Its the ultimate boredom cure for a rainy day   when youve read every book in the house  (:	Pandora was the original music discovery thing  and its still on a roll	Its not as good as bloglines organization wise  BUT the interface is lovely  and it has tagging!

46834	but i keep having problems loggin in  i have reported this and no one has got back to me  i have reported this problem several times over the last 3 days

53158	Its becoming more and more of a source of quick up to the minute information hub  It really is a social network hub  but is also more	Great if not greatest micro blogging media hub  Always the latest trending & of debate  10 out of 10 from me	Just recently started using Opera  and have become a big fan  Anything with open development is always a good thing  in my opinion  Web 5 0 is their hi point	Actually Im indifferent  Prolly best & my #1 choice of clients  Im still surprised people still use the P2P network  Newsgroups R really the way to go	A must have for those of us that enjoy and want to easily share content to our favorite social media hubs  a 10/10 from me	I somewhat like Pandora radio  but I was referred here from Avatar Pandora  lol		
87389	Im still committed to it  Theres lots of potential left  Maybe marry it to Buzz?		
3888	This is potentially very useful   If the bookmarklet was tweaked I think I would use it regularly so will keep an eye on this service	Twitter is my FriendFeed messaging sidekick  ; )	I used to use this all the time but its one of the services Ive discarded like Delicious  still very good though	Excellent service  love the scrobbler  love that thesixtyone works with it   Get good recommendations   Not as good as Pandora  but cant use Pandora now	Ive never really used it but it looks a very useful app	I rarely use it now  too busy on FriendFeed and Twitter but its an OK service   I can catch up with my real life friends with FB	The best browser on the net atm  It still needs proper script support & addons might be an interesting addition but it cant be beaten for speed and simplicity	Excellent  the premium photo editing app   But Adobe need to drop the ridiculous price tag on the new version though  no way am I upgrading! : (	Excellent site  a regular read for me	Even though theyve started removing music videos from the UK on YT its still the video site I go to first	Lots of fun and interesting to see the rest of the World   Very  very useful	Pretty useful Twitter directory	OK but Disqus is the king at the moment	Excellent new service from Kosmix  personalising your newspaper is dead simple and it looks very neat too   Very customisable	Not really used but I can see this being very useful	Love it  I swapped to Gmail permanently a year or 2 ago   Now only use Outlook to download a backup of my mail	Good  just wished scripts worked properly (or at all in the alpha/2 0 version) in Google Chrome	Perhaps not liked as much as previous  I still use it to find cool stuff and the recommendation engine seems to work for me	I need to try this more but it seems pretty useful	Potentially a very good app   But it needs FriendFeed support for me and needs to do a far better job at it than Twhirl ever did	Looks a good alternative to WMP and iTunes	Nice and simple but its Digsby for me for its integration of all the services I use   If those services in Gtalk then Id swap  : )	Pretty cool but I couldnt get into it   Im keeping an eye on it though  : )	Potentially very useful   A good service already could be great once this new all in one comments service (seen on Mashable) is released	I dont really use its unique features but might do once it swaps to Google Chrome from Firefox	Best news reader around	Well ya kinda need it nowadays  ; )	Easily the best photo sharing site out there   Love its community type features   I upload mainly to here	This seems to be the best of the bunch  but ZumoDrive might be a contender	Its got its critics but I like it  Most stable version of Windows Ive personally used   Just wished it was faster   Windows 7 looks nice though	Lots of information here  perhaps could do with a lick of paint here and there  : )	Pretty good user friendly version of Photoshop	Use this to play DVDs  very simple and useful	Potentially a very useful and interesting service   Looking forward to the upcoming WP plugin which Ill definitely add to my site	A must have for Firefox users  though I use Chrome now  ; )	Good site  but discarded it as I use too many such services   If there was a way to submit to it when I bookmark/like on other services then great  but alas	Nice app/service but not used it much	Love it  yeah there might be the odd mistake here and there but its the reference site of choice for me   The design is great!	Good site  well theyve bought this site so gotta say I like them  ; )	Its good but  for me  its memory hungry and very slow!  I use it mainly for the sidekicks  Last fm and iLike sidebars	Brilliant  I found LOTS of new music with this   I just wished it worked outside of the US again  : (	Certainly better than IE (love lots of the plugins and its features) I prefer Google Chrome for its speed and simplicity		
86084	finally just got the blackberry app and so far so good   its a lot of fun!		
69503	hmmmm   so far so gud		
66477	Your opinion of this app in 160 characters ohttp://www blippr com/home/edit/servicesr less		
2571	Ties together all your social networking needs into one  Firefox based browser  Still has teething problems but once you use it you wont want anything else	I just wish more of my friends used it!		
74099	now days i am unable to log in properly as well as attachment of certain files  This has been experienced in the recent past Any technical problems please		
53161	Sounds great!  Looking forward to a new communication venue!  Sindy		
83805	Twitter is more for functionality than social networking  in my opinion		
83811	cool  style able		
10877	It has the best design of all time  No other website even comes close to it in terms of freshness and simplicity		
79794	Twitter the Town Cryer of our generation  Love it!		
49091	Kool way to stay connected with your professional colleagues		
78468	So far  its great  That said  I havent had to do a restore  But you can map the cloud space as a drive  so direct file access shouldnt be a problem

43790	its unfreakingbelieveable am glad ive joined the group of happy faces		
3898	I didnt like using it with Twitter (Used DestroyTwitter instead)  but it supports FriendFeed very well	Looks and feels right  But I would like a landscape keyboard option	My favorite Twitter app		
34847	On my old  clunky computer Chrome is super quick to load and easy to navigate   Love it!		
10875	great idea  really usefull    thats all! :)		
71814	The world be come closer		
86074	I love google but I love Chicago OBGYN John Weitzner more  http://www JWeitzner com		
71832	I love Mashable!  This site has the most current and useful information that simplifies the overwhelming and chaotic interweb   Get web savvy with Mashable yo!	Gmail is the best thing to ever happen to the inbox!		
43780	By replacing folders with labels  it makes email so much easier!	Twitter is amazing!  If only more people used it though		
69515	use it to read all my friends blog posts  useful because they are all in one page!	best search engine EVA		
80768	Very useful and a wealth of information		
46818	Nice   It does not support plug ins like FireFox   It is faster then Firefox or IE   Wish it has a few more configurable option in the preferences		
42459	it sure is easy to sign up  I like it		
6939	specially like its games :D	always tries to load basic html!		
10888	This is great   I just web space off godaddy  started a blog  and learned the value of RSS feeds (which is how I found out about this offer!) Perfect timing

29495	My Review in 160 Characters???? are you kidding me? 140! its 140!		
53174	Getting better with time		
29499	It serves more purpose for people who know how to use it effectively		
10884	I get some interesting ideas from it! Thanx!		
28161	Its very sociable  I like Twit Army as well  its Twitter only more directed to a particular group of people with the same interest!  COMPUTERS!!!!	Google has it GOING ON In the morning when I get on the net  its like Christmas when I see a new GOOGLE App	fastest browser on the net    I like FAST!		
10883	heyy! thats G R E AT :)		
33504	I found blippr through StumbleUpon! Not recommended for the procrastinator!		
92784	Perfect choice for us   Firefox everytime	It has to be one of my favorite applications ever  Its having a real impact on our social media   We love it!	Drop Box is really excellent online sharing and collaboration tool   works perfectly with our Apple Macs	Just getting the hang of using it at the moment but   it seems really good for managing all of our social media accounts in one place   plus we love the stats	I use this to update and review all of the my tweets   has worked well for me so far	Use it everyday as a business resource and also to keep up to date with the comedy clips and videos that are out there	The best thing for international calls  As Long as you dont mind wearing a headset :)	Use it everyday   normally it works perfectly  but sometimes it can be having a bad day and take forever to load		
91458	Finally  intelligent two way social communication		
90127	Not quite ready for prime time  but with time it will be compelling		
46809	Great to find new interesting or funny photos  but you dont get much space unless you pay $25/year	Good  but the ads are very repetitive		
58871	Twitter Is The Opium Of The Masses		
2592	Finding it useful  but messy		
37093	Really The God Father of Streaming Videos		
57545	i love facebook cause its hot		
34821	I love this wonderful application  only need net social functions to be totally perfect		
10859	Friendfeed is the greatest social media tool  Its community is really cool		
57541	hahahahaha cool as lol (:		
56213	i like to fly with my girl  but no girl friend		
70504	I think its great     but could do with more intergration from google chat     Would be nice to be able to use it in a desktop app rather than on the browser		
66491	its cool to know what everybody is doing  Your friends  family and even celebs!	Better than Google! Love the way Images are displayed and Birds Eye view on Bing Maps is great! :D		
68203	Great Themes  Plugins   easy to use  install and understand! I Love Wordpress! :D	Youtube easy to find/view videos you want to watch! Easy to upload aswell  nice theme easy on the eyes! Everyone Loves YT	How can you not like Google    unless you work for Microsofts Bing	Love it! Fast  Great Add ons  Themes   much better than any other browser out there! :D		
65175	i like it but its a little TOO OPEN   i need a little privacy   why should all my friends see what all my other friends are saying to me	i love google   they are a very unique company   they are capable of doing anything and have the resources and money to do it  they are the modern day microsoft		
68202	yea its good i like facebook		
70521	It works  Hate the cones though		
69535	I lurve it    as long as it can show me what i want to see from this website   heehehhe		
29473	Skype and Facebook chat worked easy peasy on my N82  whats not to like?	Hard to get the full benefit on wordpress com  suspect hosting myself is the way to unleash the power within		
31785	Best browser out so far	Just started using this  Great access to music  but navigating the site is difficult		
29479	results should be more graphical  and more organized  not just a plain listing		
77148	 Another time  i shall give to you my opinion on it  after to have taken a little moment to see it very well  Okay  bye and next time !		
10861	Plurk is simple and fun to use as a microblogging site  No API gives it a lower rating from me though	Great time waster  Good way to discover different parts of the web	Gwibber is a microblogging app that updates twitter  identica  jaiku and the like with your status updates  Runs on Linux only	Ubuntu is my linux system  I run it on two computers	Good jumping off point for information	Simple way to integrate comments into your site  I use it for Tumblr	I think this is the only way to read RSS feeds  The best web based reader	Friendfeed is easy to use and improving all the time	Facebook is ok  Too many apps out there for my taste	Linkedin is good for business related connections	Gmail is the only email I need	Good  but not as good as it could be    especially after requiring people from other countries to pay to use their radio service	Microblogging  Thats all I have to say		
50922	Great app  makes me want a smartphone		
70517	Just fine  The app on blackberry needs to be improved		
49063	i love facebook x :)		
71864	Great interface  reliable  spam is NOT an issue (unless youre adding your name to lists yourself)		
91473	orkut is online community designed to make social life more active	i love imeem to share music videos photos and create playlist	u tube is the leader of online video and I like its videos Number one in the world of videos	wordpress is very interesting blogging platform	twitter is very interesting to follow the person you want	flicker is self proclaimed share photos online I like it		
43753	rhinteractive    the quintessential early adopter    late bloomer ;)		
90144	Not sure what problem I have the it solves		
90147	I am okay with facebook and stuff without Buzz   I found Buzz slightly confusing   great idea   maybe I check it sometime later		
10829	Newcomer to last fm  but instantly hooked		
57562	I think blippr is cool!!!!!!!!!		
77174	Very convenient way of summarising your background acting as a virtual resume	They say that knowledge is power therefore sharing knowledge is a means of empowering others and increasing common understanding  which makes a better world		
90141	I think google buzz will be better once people on google buzz talk about more than google buzz and whether google buzz is better than twitter or facebook		
90140	I havent seen a TON of difference between this and twitter other than you can post longer sentences and your profile is more accessible to strangers		
56238	the only think that might could be better is wave :p		
29444	An easy interface for reviewing stuff  Custom tweet format would be nice		
83852	I love it  but i would love even more  if Google would buy it  so i could use my 80GB Google Storage		
50930	Its fun  App invitations get annoying though	My favorite email service		
5634	Its very very basic and simple app & its really recommend for twitter newbies No pain neck settings nor features to choose on Yeah its only add on what  hmm	Having own blog & domain is really possible with blogger service Just simple as a piece of cake Just sign up with e mail ID & get to your blogging world	Whats more better in online activities if not share the link & bookmarks in a single room	Im simply LOVE this app its a fantastic way to connect with buddies & at the same time can spread the word in single update Kudos to the founders   !!!	It makes things much more easier with just get know your updates in a single predecessor  without have to sign up every time to open an app	It makes the browsing session extremely cool & exciting	Array of colour schemes & fonts to choose on  It makes tweet updates more interesting Its worth using	Manage the desktop icons by put in one place & invisible way to clears the clutter Its pretty clean	Its a HUGE WORLD for videos You just name it  IT will play it	Who dont like to browse web with smooth & speed? Opera is my 2nd choice after FF   Excellent Fast & Clear  Absolutely brilliant choice	Unlimited titles & topics to find out  Real feed for information seekers Youll never dry out information	Come on man  Its cool windows that Im using right now  since 98	I like the wordpress theme & the surrounding for its classy clean & eye appeal outlook which completely deviate from normal blog	Haha  its not monkey at all but its  very helpful buddie with javascript thinggy Im using it for download Apple movie trailers easy as pie	Simple clean & cool Friendly UI and exactly my 2nd choice after FF	Google never need to be explained why its an excellent search engine	Same UI like Tweetdeck but I still prefer Seesmic for its better management system Kinda easy	Communicate in a professional way & can get the world wide open	Its really good idea but Im always scared with the over expose features which can make criminals to get information easily Seriously consider this  !!!	Decent fast & pretty cool data transfer at a time Throw your portable devices if you dont like or hate this coolest data transfer app Youll lose easiness	The environment really cool & eye appeal   Users even can upload clip in HD format Best place for creative mind	I dont know which platform will be the best place to share the crisp clear photos none other than Flickr itself	No matter how many social networks you have it makes the thing extremely easier for your buddies to follow your updates in a single platform		
37062	A truly addictive communication in the disguise off one way blurbing		
38393	very nice search engine  Im very impressed Ive never tought I will let down google

47244	I use it for all my email accounts and RSS feeds	Way better than ASP	I like how it shows information in the bottom frame about the song youre listening to  The embedded browser might have been overkill but otherwise very nice	Very useful tool for voip and video chat  Unfortunately it charges you to call landlines	I like its attempt to integrate all sorts of web tools into one app  The problem is its slow for me and the IRC part of it sucks  Ill stick to FF for now  :)	Ubuntu 9 04 is the best OS Ive ever used so far  Although I did hate it when 8 04 was the latest release  Never tried 8 10 though  I was using SUSE at the time	Definitely the best social networking site  Plus all my friends are using it  Its very organized and a great way to see what my friends are up to every day	Way better than Windows  It allows me to actually FIX the problem instead of restarting and hoping the problem magically gets fixed	Great for playing weird formats  It unfortunately doesnt have a library to organize my media in so I use Rhythmbox for the most part instead	Everything Ive seen Google come out with is done amazingly  Except for Google Pages  I didnt like the organization of that	Its a very handy app  I added on the Facebook  Skype  and Twitter plugins to make it support ALL my protocols	I like how easy it is to figure out  I was able to figure it out within 10 mins  Im still trying to figure out squarespace and I only get 14 days free with it	Great video sharing tool	A pretty cool service  Good use of AJAX    IF I COULD USE IT  Google Maps refuses to work on Firefox 3 0 13 for Ubuntu and Google Earth wont work either	Im not a photographer and I dont really upload pictures but a lot of the other pictures that people upload can be pretty cool	Now that theres a release for Linux I love it  Its way less of a RAM hog than Firefox (on Linux at least) All it needs is a Solaris release and and more addons	It compiles basic knowledge of a subject that people know into an article  Also very convenient for information and definitely underrated	I love this  It suggests great music for me all the time and I dont even have to go to the website  I can see it all in Rhythmbox music player	Definitely the best email service  It supports POP/IMAP and lets you use it for FREE (unlike Yahoo) and doesnt throw ads all over your messages	I love Blippr because it doesnt allow people to ramble on about how much they hate or love something  Plus my attention span is short

Lets just say that Bing is too horrible to describe in comparison to Google   Google FTW!	If you want a blog  this is the place to get it   Offers so much more functionality than other blog sites   If you really want to make your blog good  use  org	A MUST have for all Twitter ers	Its really good   I really like the Labs features   I also like how Google Apps uses Gmail   For my main email  I use outlook  but I do have a gmail	How can I not love mashable when it is the way I discovered blippr? =P	I really love Launchy   I dont use it  though   It seems that I always forget to use it   I think that the Vista search works find  so I save the disk space	is it possible to not like facebook?  However  I do hate the new newsfeed   I cant wait until the homepage update outlined on Mashable that is  overall  better	I love Google Reader   I have it as my homepage and I check my feeds every day   Occasionally  the interface will not respond  but a refresh always fixes it	It is just so great   Convenient  well designed  great functionality  customizable  etc	What a great way to vent your thoughts in 140 characters or less :D

10825	Blippr  Vimeo  Veoh  and other media sites all rolled into one which in part  was Googles overall design mechanism is doing very well indeed	Wikis and the global information sharing environment is an essential part of who we are and of our history and arts	More information not APIs is necessary to understand Android but anything Google  works fine including BUZZ!	I joined Vimeo as I received numerous tips from mentors and helpful marketers all steering me into the real world of video and of its upcoming popularity	Flickr and Picasa go hand in hand  both allow a satisfying user experience but more importantly  they allow online exposure and pagerank algorithms at play	Everything including BUZZ helps us find balance in our online usage  Well Done Google!

82632	It re invigorated the browser wars and gave IE a well deserved run for its money  Truly a superior browsing experience	There are plenty of ways to update files between multiple computers and get online storage  but this one just works and you never have to think about it  Great!	Hands down  Google Maps beat MapQuest at its own game  Fast  smart  powerful  and backed by Google  What else could you ask for?	IE is the heavyweight; Firefox is a superior  lightweight alternative; Chrome is a reinvention of browsing simplicity  Like all things Google  it just works	Amazing mobile OS  period  The devs at Google have done something truly special with Android and I can no longer see it being anything other than my #1 choice	An amazing mail client  Many features rival that of the largest desktop clients  plus you can access it anywhere and you get the benefit of amazing spam filters	One of the best things to ever happen to the web  The greatest enhancement to web searching since web searching was introduced  Google is the web search king	Destined for greatness (I hope)  No need to carve a new niche  just do it better than Twitter  and the user base is already there	A good alternative to the overly bloated and frantic MySpace  and it offers far more features and tools than Twitter  But those apps and games are so annoying!	imeem was a truly outstanding service until it was gobbled up and utterly destroyed by MySpace last December  Thanks a lot  MySpace	Nothing amazing  but its a decent idea in todays fast moving Internet driven world  although it is used for entirely the wrong purpose much of the time	Fun to configure  simple to customize and install plugins  very open and non restrictive  and it seems to naturally look professional  A wonderful blogging tool	Where did people go for information before Wikipedia? To a collection of outdated and expensive books  Welcome to the public encyclopedia for the digital age

Tweetie does what I need it to do  URL shortening and Twitpic support is great and you cant beat the killer interface	Twitter is addictive  fun  and friendly to connect with people you know and people you dont  The only problem I have is spam   get rid of auto DMers!	Must read for social media addicts  Ive found some of the best web content from reading Mashable	It isnt exactly useful because most of the time Im wasting time using it but Google Earth is nonetheless really cool!

8813	Simply the best  the very best		
10143	Need to take information with grain of salt  but overall a fine example of what can be done with a social app bounded mainly by a level of self governance	Very convenient to bookmark at work and at home  Beats keeping a log of favorite sites to share with others eventually		
87423	Love Linux but it will never be mainstream because there is no one version that developers can write apps for!	I would like to see this specific OS progress and evolve to be the MS Windows of the Mobile OS world!		
87424	Its amazing  I can check my mails (from other accounts as well)  I can chat & now I can even Gweet (Buzz)  Can we say it Gwitter Book  ? www DezinoGraphist com		
11473	=D I love this site  what value it has!  They could easily be charging a monthly fee for what they offer!

11478	Finally found a site to digest what it is and where it is going   I can now make intelligent choices and make events work for me  not the mystical or		
8817	All the web into one single station  But its not as fast as it was before!	We live in a Google called Earth	So far  so good  Simpler and more useful than this  only Twitter		
8818	Gmail is the best e mail application there is  I always found Hotmail and Yahoo mail to be ugly and old fashioned  but then Gmail came along  Fabulous	It may be a little slower than a couple of other browsers  but its major advantage is all the plug ins  The best out there and miles better than IE		
11479	ustream is a  huge service: free live broadcast on the web with chat  Twitter  polls and linked subtitles  Excelent! ;)	Seems like a good way to improve blog visits! ;)		
3144	not addicted  but its good   getting sticky enough to stop fickle users moving on	different  but better than twitter	loads quicker than firefox   seems to make my computer freeze after about 6hrs of solid use   still  worth it for the UX	cant beat it   no need for a PC based client any more	left pandora for it (3 yrs ago)   wont be going back		
32383	I think Friendfeed is making a comeback   Lately Ive been getting more subscribers and I think that Im making better use of it

54530	Google Reader has made my internet use grow with 50%  Now I have all my favorite sites and blogs new right in one place  I love it!		
15807	Firefox itself is great  Easy to organise and transport bookmarks  Tabs are fab  Some of the add ons arent great but you cant blame Firefox for that I guess		
32388	I think Twitter is great  I joined simply to see what the fuss was about and didnt expect much  but now I use twitter more often any other web service

536	I have been a user of Wordpress for 5 years and their services really work  Amazing content managnent system	Flickr is the best photo sharing service with the best community !	I have been Twitter user since its very first days  when it was just a side project of Odeo in 2006 Now I really like it well I do miss the free sms capabilitie	Blippr made some cool changes lately  I am an early adopter too  would be good if they have bog ratings and better profiles	Its just firefox    with all the plugins one needs    it rocks the web		
10110	Great place to find info on anything	Its fantastic when its not hogging all my memory!	Ill love it when it gets extensions    but will it still be speedy?		
36740	i like to share on facebook		
79838	Their search algorithms keep developers accountable so they have to build real sites with real content  PPC limits mean the rich dont rule the web  G rocks!		
8822	Excellent browser but has had a few issues with the more recent versions   Maybe its time for a complete system rebuild	Fast  Really Fast!  But I have encountered a few sites/applications that dont work properly in chrome   Meh  still a much better solution than IE		
53205	its amazing  kamran shahkohi		
8829	the BEST Social Bookmarking site i ever used  i m quite obsessed about it :)	its fine but Combine features of Facebook   Orkut  Diigo   Plurks Time View would be better   Sounds weird   well thats me  and my choice :P	liked its  timeline view but i found non of my buddies use it  so i evetually not use it anymore	Quite Kool :)	i owe u Linus Torvalds(Linux Creator)   Mark Shuttleworth (Ubuntu Creator) & RMS of GNU  GPL  FOSS  FSF Creator to save me fm Micro$oft Window$ Tax :)	BEST BitTorrent Client  its sad it does not hav a Linux version    but i m trying to run it thru Wine :)	THE BEST  MAPPING SOFTWARE   i cant believe i  can see my homes satellite   pix    its awesomely good :)	best for window$ system   thou u dont need anything like this in Ubuntu Linux :)	what can i say   its the BEST and every Body knows it )	liked its word search in Picture very much  need more social aspect	Mashable  LifeHacker & TorrentFreak is my 3 MOST Fav  Blogs :)	its good but did not understand why people r crazy about it??	for trivia its ok   but there is no surety that the info in wikipedia is True  also lots of higher label editors r biased myopic and narrow minded :X	most useful feed reader :)		
12778	The best email service ever existed	nice idea  not the best ui ive seen		
53209	hai2      hehehehe give me follower more than 100 pless :p		
12776	best windows yet  MS gettin a grip of things in the desktop area?! ;D	even beter now with multi account suppport =)	its ok  but getting extremely tired of all this quizzes  Can people either stop taking them or give us a chance to block ALL quizzes and not just 1 specific!!		
67850	So lightweight and snappy    something that FireFox can no longer claim  unfortunately		
62163	Im new On Twitter But I Very Like It But Remember Twitter Is Not a chat		
44353	Programming for the iPhone is much easier now   if only theyd make memory management more transparent		
8840	My favorite piece of software  period	Simple  intuitive email  raised the bar for all other webmail services		
75475	Wikipedia is the best overall resource Ive used PERIOD	Best browser IMO		
66526	SU is unique among bookmarking and related sites  I like using it  The social elements of it are lacking (or just not really happening)  though		
48717	I have drunk the kool aid and now I can run a four minute mile with Google at my side!		
543	The easy bloging tool for the rest of us;)	Little fox is not so little any more	Simply amazing photo hosting site	With more friends joining in its the best place on the web;)	The easiest bloging tool which is becoming more and more addictive		
31042	For a non programmer like me  Wordpress and its army of plugins is the bizniss	prefer Tumblr as it is faster  but Flickr is handy		
32373	Does everything it needs to and is stable  Never have to worry about running out of space	Good  But a complete memory hog	Good for connecting with people you may not otherwise keep in touch with  But bloated  applications are unstable  chat is rarely working   too much like myspace	Good   but lacking the equivalent of Firefoxs extensions  Till it has add on support  Im staying with Firefox	Its whatever you want it to be  Without it  blippr wouldnt exist!	Fantastic for finding new music  even if its far from mainstream!		
50189	I  am  new  to  twitter   I  actually  saw  it  on  the  CNN  news  channel		
8835	Excellent service for both discovering new sites and bookmarking the ones you like!	Quite an amazing micro blogging service   Makes you kind of an addict!	Amazing app  the columns feature is great!

11451	I love everything about Google  Its just perfect	Ive been addicted to Twitter since the moment I signed up  which was roughly a year after its launch		
36731	Also in my Top 5  Dont like that you can only fast forward so many times  but by creating a new station you can get around that  Great suggestions	Definitely in my music top 5  Love the suggestions  love the variety  love the scrobbling from multiple sources  love the idea  love that its free!		
12782	I like that Twitter is quick and short   Keep on tweeting!!!		
12783	transparent  simple  doesnt steal value from its users		
11453	makes it easier to keep up with stuff	this is only way to keep track of my books lol		
12788	This is the best Texas Holdem site i have used  Great Graphics and a table for all skill levels! Overall a great site!		
36733	its fast  smooth  and it feells like natural to me  I still have firefox installed  but  thinking of that  I hardly use it anymore		
87442	Keeps spam out  runs with my mobile devices  works all day every day		
35408	great! pity that it consumes too much memory  Wish it would have productive/management tools like Foxmarks included with its code reviewed to ensure security		
10127	yes they are smug  but they have the bestest search engine		
11458	I just love twitter! Perfect to stay in touch with friends   even more  to sat in touch with the world and keep track of whats going on around me :))		
10126	The best microblogging platform cum social aggregator site out there  Whatever is out there friendfeed is two steps ahead in terms of thought and action	Scrobbles my music and keeps track of what I am listening and lets me see what my friends are listening to  Great customisable online radio too	Fast  Very fast  thats good  Simple  too simple  Thats bad  Having no add ons is a severe handicap  Several sites still dont run properly on it	Simple  elegant  effective and a great community  Beats all other photo sites by miles	Am a huge fan of firefox  Cant live w/o it  Totally changed the way I use internet! The add ons make it so functional and knockout every other browser out there	The first place to go to keep in touch with social media  What it lacks in design is made up with content  They should add more features and grow as a website	It is THE BEST twitter client for desktops for heavy twitter users  Supreme functionality & constant innovation make it awesome  It is also one of best AIR app	A really good multi im client out there  Very functional and good looking but bulky and cumbersome at times  Can improve a lot and has got potential to be best!

12754	Hmm its a nice service but I would rather recommend Intense Debates commenting system  (http://intensedebate com/)		
92817	Its awesome   Much better than Wordpress		
87460	a great place to search and listen to music!	damn tiny! :)		
8861	I dont know how I could even still do Twitter without TweetDeck   It is great for organizing everything and sifting through tweets		
66540	i am manoj i am srilanka  i am good man

8883	Works great  I find it easy to navigate and customize  I need a bigger bookmarks bar though	Good for online shelf  Appearance wise this is the best of the virtual shelves  Clear cover pics and fancy cases	Great site  lots of info & interesting sites  I have found some really neat things via Digg  But at times I wish theyd believe me that my submission is unique	Extensive and comprehensive  My favorite online library site  Definitely the best web library for all info regarding the book world	Im waiting for the day when Google simply doesnt blow my mind  Google Earth vastly went beyond anything I had expected of it	I like it for quickly keeping bookmarks  Good at sorting through tags and categories	I cannot express in words how much I love Mashable! Its the first email I open when I get to work and it takes priority over the next 30 minutes  Best source	Of course  But Im pissed about the cost of upgrading	Fun for those times you have time  Takes you to some rarely seen sites that should be seen more often  Also helps organize your personal favorites	I really like iTunes  I know most hate having to pay but aside from that I love the fact that I can buy a cd at 3:15am and have it loud & clear in a minute	Lots of options and control for all Twitter accounts	Flickr is the site that I find myself spending hours on without meaning to have even signed in  Its incredible  My strongest addiction on the web	Good page source  Submission process is a bit tiring  but keeps info relevant for the most part	I like it too  good of Mashable to buy it and inform me about it! Great site	Grand  Great starting point for any kind of research  Info is usually reliable and correct    but I always re check it  Format is perfect for an encyclopedia

590	This has quickly replaced firefox for me during all normal browsing   I love it  [Also love have an irrational love of google    so yeah]	Gmail redefined email for me   If I could use it for everything I would   It is nearly perfect	Im blipping that I love the IDEA of it   Cant wait to use it in practice!

81290	Have been using it more since getting a netbook    i find it requires a decent size screen		
81292	Its simply brilliant  Its based on the same philosophy as 37signalss services  I bet it will have a lot of cool features in the future		
14459	I love Firefox  I have converted many friends to it  far away from IE  The customization it has is just fantastic!	My boyfriend just turned me on to Google Reader  I can now easily surf all of my news  including Mashable and Digg at the click of ONE button and in only 1 Tab!	pandria com  nuff said!	I often refer to IMDB for info on movies  actors  and upcoming films!	Only been using it a short while  but seems okay so far	I think its a great communication and networking tool  plus  its fun to sit and read through what others are doing at the exact same moment you are!		
13128	Has its flaws but generally speaking a revolution in communication  I use it for work and hobbies  Its great for news debate and its a great networking tool	The best way to get your twitter and facebook updates & keep them organised  The layout is simple & clear  you can create groups & it has useful link shortner		
71019	The shopping search and cashback feature are great		
72349	lets see         idont have much idea?

39744	Good  but prefer to use Twitter directly on the mobile	Very cool  especially avoids need for Real Audio and other crappy players	Brilliant for playing specific tracks  The radio function needs improvement badly	Undeniably the best blog platform  Possibly the most powerful CMS too	Probably the most use app on our PCs	Looks really cool  in terms of function  but I dont like having their brand look so prominent on our site	Usually interesting  I still prefer TechCrunch for getting news first	Probably the simplest and most usable Firefox   Twitter plugin	While the mobile browser itself is good  the mobile emulator is absolutely excellent for testing mobile websites	Very cool  but pointless for daily use	Extremely handy tool	Interesting  but not the most intuitive interface  Sharing files often requires a bit of hand holding with new users	Still good  Does exactly what it says on the box and has been doing so for almost as long as the Internets been around	This is their original  and still their best piece of technology ever	Great concept  We use it all the time	Love how much better Office 2007 is than Office XP  Lots more interesting features  Outlook 2007 should have HTML email support though	Theres some cool  not so mainstream content on there  but in the end  this site has nothing that YouTube doesnt	Not Microsofts best OS  XP and Windows 7 both out classed Vista	Our desktop Twitter app of choice  Very handy for multiple accounts (office  personal etc) and lots of easy to use functionality without crowding the interface	Interesting  Not sure if it will replace IMDB for movie recommendations  but      time will tell	Good for the lazy / photoshop challenged	Brilliant  Ground breaking	Definitely our favourite free Anti Virus software	Nice to have  easy to use	Really neat stuff  and especially handy for quick edits to Flickr images  Would help if they expanded the functionality on Flickr  E g  paintbrush tool	Extremely useful and brilliantly priced : )	Favourite way to discover interesting new sites and while away hours on idle browsing	Definitely one of the best Twitter add on sites	Best business network out there  Could be a bit better in terms of its new addon functionality e g  blog & slideshare integration	Significant improvements over XP and Vista  Could be faster to boot  The inability to pin Mini Media Player to taskbar is a fail point	Very useful if you want to grow your Twitter reach  However  the service can be quite slow	Definitely the most powerful image editor  Using it for years  and still continue to discover cool new features	Makes a helluva lot of user satisfaction / PR mistakes but still the best social network out there		
7568	Gmail is fantastic   I used to do all my works on it !	youre on it blipping and blipping how can you say that you dont like this site ;)	the best video site ever   you can find any video on it     it is one of my favorite sites that I cant live without :D

84337	its awesome  good blogging platform		
52761	es genaeal aunq todavia nolo actualizo pero creo q estara chido		
35365	I liked it while I was into secular music  good songs  nice graphics  a bit laggy    When will we be able to make our own tap tracks? Tap Tap Jesus coming soon		
46011	Im however still annoyed that Apple insist to use iTunes for most of their programs  Especially Apple tv  which is useless as long as i runs through iTunes	Great video player that can play almost any format	Im a huge fan of this site		
15774	it has some very interesting features to connect all of us regular folks together with the crazy overspeeding world out there		
50104	nice app  great stuff		
39728	Its Fine  prevented an iframe attack	I love it! I even got a profile on it! (Only thing is that it is too popular)	Very cool for people with low space on their hard drive	I love it! (Especially the latest version  but it wont broadcast to FriendFeed)	95% of people use it! I do too! Love the services!	I love it  My Twitter is now a exact copy of FriendFeed now	Youll find many great sites	Great twitter tool	Only Windows  Puuuu  But the accounts actually use XMPP/Jabber	Like the compelling upload video & picture site   but I dont use it and is owned by the News Corp	I love it in the fact that is that is a open source media player   which is rare	My all time browser behind Opera  :P	I like Disqus  in it that in many ways	Its a great client for Twitter  I personally use it  but hate its Facebook support	Its concept is great   but the downsides that blipprs got no support about it	I had a Yahoo! account for it  so    (I dont use it much  but used to)	Mostly GarageBand like NINJA90 says	And loving it thanks to Reader2Twitter	I love the concept and I have been invited as well  Quite cool  Id say	An decent open source Photoshop	Its OK  but it really wants you to pay :(	Tries its best to do what it does  but I think it needs MOAR work	I use it for my blog and it is great!	Default URL trimmer for Twitter  and I use it sometimes	I like it on my Linux machines	Google Analytics is glaring stats	Newbies to computers will love it! I love it too!	But alas flickrs better	Simply *THE BEST* e mail client out there	It is good for finding information  but is spammed alot	It is a good programming language! No wonder its used almost everywhere!		
9301	No other email client compares to Gmail	Clean interface  Google still needs to work out some JavaScript issues so that it is compatible with more web2 0 apps		
11382	Love it ! Fast and light  what do you need more ?		
15740	great way to share pictures on the go with friends  old and new

63422	Gmail provides good and quick service  it has added so much new and latest supports to its services   yeah  but gmail apps for window mobile are required		
75402	A much more powerful  faster  innovative and secure web browser  There are extensions for almost anything  Choose Firefox for a great web browsing experience	Wikipedia is a great concept but I feel that it is very much bloated and usefulness as well as reliability can be very questionable!	Lets keep this short and sweet! For that is what blippr is all about!	Mashable is the most amazing social media blog out there and I must confess that I honestly use this on a daily basis!	I love my iPhone 3GS! It does everything I need it to do and more! It is packed with features and applications for almost anything! Cant leave home without it!	I love the refinements in the user interface in Windows 7  Pinning icons for your most used programs to the taskbar adds sophistication  Sexy  fast and simple!	This is THE definitive Twitter client app on the iPhone! Sexy and functional! Does everything you need it to do and more!	I am #twitaddicted! Too many tweets  so little time! This is truly one of the most remarkable examples of web/social media innovation of our time!	Absolutely awesome music streaming service and I love the premium subscription which lets you use this on your iPhone and save off line playlists!	Great concept but this doesnt always work in practice! Improved accuracy would make this much more useful  Super app to discover music though!		
51441	i really love it cuz itz soooo cool		
84367	estou muito feliz		
46000	The best thing since GPS!

39710	buzzon is the best twitter application		
76747	I love tweetie for iphone   tried the rest  but keep coming back	Gmail is simply the best email service Ive ever used		
11387	Much better with a Wacom or something like that ;)	I f***ing love this one  It comes with lot of codecs	I really like using Safari on my Mac but not on Windows platforms  Also I found S4 much more memory expensive that S3 but maybe is just my impression	I just cant imagine internet wo Wikipedia  Cooperative knowledge works and roolez :)		
15748	Blows every other social networking and location based site out of the water  Inline pictures  comment capabilities  solid privacy features & a great community!		
39714	Couldnt live without twitter   check with me in 1 year  it could go the way of MySpace ;)	I wish it was easier to find old messages  once you trash them or send them  its like a needle in a haystack  is this beta still? LOL		
50117	awesome blogging platform with an excellent backend		
10058	See the world from your door step   know where youre heading to and with street view   guess I cant lost as easily now   Just need to plan ahead		
15746	Twitter can be so much more than a microblog/social network  If you want  it can condense your whole online life 140 characters at a time	A good blend between other blogging apps and Twitter  Its like blogging express  Couldnt be easier to use yet still suitable for advanced bloggers		
95008	The best of the best with the best!	Its not easy to describe it but really I cant open firefox without opening twitter tab  it became of primary websites I open daily  #thankstwitter4		
11390	I prefer this over Discus & Im a Wordpress follower  It also got bought up by Automattic (Wordpress developers) so it makes sense  It has plugins now too!	Simply the best  End of!		
10062	the place to update people i actually know

Status  location  media and relationships all threaded together into the best networking communit	This is a meet people with things in common network that ends up being a nice catalog of pop culture  Great for compulsive collectors and list makers!		
15757	Very cost effective    when pirated	Probably the most comfortable language ever developed	By far the fastest  Just needs AdBlock		
11360	With twitter u can know whats happening right now!   u just need to follow the right people		
67800	Excellent; fast; weeds out all the spam; not crowded with ads; easily customized and unlimited storage that you can use for backing up your computer free!

10909	I like it and feel that it will be improved in areas where it is not (being in alpha)		
10908	Easy to keep up with certain timely events  such as sports events  but becomes cumbersome at times; often  too many personal tweets from business oriented sites		
90180	I like Buzz and I think well see a lot of improvements as we go along		
9362	I said I love it    :D	its OK   but not so revolutionar as people thinking    simply OK   :)		
9360	I dont like being followed but if I can get a hot deal on sunglasses Im in!		
56271	cool  very cool  I am new here exploring	lets see  but looks it will be veeery good!		
90184	Its a smart  strategic move on Googles part since it allows them to take advantage of their whole platform on Android handsets (duh)		
83898	LOVED THAT SORORITY LIFE !		
10912	one of the best photo media sites ive ever come across  i urge everyone to get at least the free account if not the pro account  Its worth it by the way	i havent tried it much  but so far so good		
82563	i just like it and also can also learn from it :)		
29521	Mixed feelings  Phishtube good  Tila Tequila  well  journalists who claim twitter is changing our lives should be forced to watch her cam show  :P	Its great but if youve been around online communication awhile it looks more like a radical re imagining of irc than something new		
81234	I travel so much  its great to find new places		
13189	Cant make it through the day without a lil Mashable!		
49131	I HAVE JUST JOIN IT SO I HAVE RIGHT NOW NO REVIEW

Cant image my computer work without this program  And never will change it for analog  because it is the best one for manage torrents	Life important thing! :)	Great music community  the largest  library  recommendations and online radio  Bad that free only at USA  UK	This is simple messaging  Can be useful for posting announcements  As for me  i not see much point in using this service as individual		
90176	Has great potential to rule the social networking world		
13195	Look forward to the informative tweets every day!  Petes picture is always worth waking up to as well

13199	I often find the comments  tips and links to articles very useful  cool   Keep them coming		
13196	Mashable is my favorite resource for keeping up with social media		
93204	Its the best blog Ive ever used   I cant wait to try hosting on my own site	Its a really fun app  I just wish more people had it so we could all share the fun!

1400	its the juggernaut of web video		
82553	Lost 80% of the songs on my imeem playlists    songs that came from imeem  I despise these myspace dipshts  The big question: What site replaces imeem the best?		
82554	i love the game its great		
38478	Its user interface is awesome  but so is the browser itself  It renders pages accurately  and fast  Trumps Firefox in my opinion		
81220	i need a female friend		
14492	Twitter is addictive  It just gets easier to share thanks to Mobile Tweeting and firefox plugins  Its truly Micro Blogging	This is the only RSS feed colletor service I use  I simply love it the concept of RSS  Would love to see the concept of filters in GReader!		
13161	I have a love/hate with Yelp   love that it uncovers local places that wouldnt get noticed by media  but hate the meaningless star ratings system		
13162	Cant remember what I did before! Tremendous tool for realizing how the planet is not that big and were all very similar		
39795	Its best   but competitors are also performing   Now a days I am also opting for bing		
38464	love good jokes know any		
37135	easy to use easy to view!!		
62972	its the easies way to blog share ideas		
9380	This is really good  For all the stuff that you cant possibly get to read   file them into your Evernote account and access them on Mac  PC  web and iPhone		
8053	Robust and clean! Integrated chat  OCD enabling features  Its awesome and constantly getting better	Blippr beat me in the eye with a stick		
29508	Facebook is for your real friends  Twitter is for your online friends  Thats the way I look at it		
61639	Im a little slow on it  but am learning pretty quick dont love it dont hate it but im in between		
85611	Love the conversations in realtime  In that sense  is better than Facebook	I have many addons (some uneccesary)  But so  I mustnt search every page  for example i have Gmail Notifier  The search bar is fantastic	Good organization: labels  filters  starred  No more spam in inbox (ok  almost)  I like labs  but is difficult to find what is enable		
13169	It has a lot of useful information		
81251	Useful to keep track of my tasks for various projects  Good reminder functionality		
13167	Lots of good stuff  Lots of good starting points for further inquiry

9398	its pretty cool seeing what the rest of the world is up to   its tweet :)	what can i say fb is just another addiction to add to the list   i just cant get enuff  :)		
13176	Mashable is relevant & well written  A great resource for bloggers & marketing professionals  Can count on it to cover the latest in the Web 2 0 world & beyond		
39783	Very fast and simple  Great combination	great app in your iphone  I use it a lot!		
73633	The fastest browser option  but still lacks something to become my browser of choice	A great browser with an absurd potential  i hope the upcoming versions fix the bloating problems though		
38455	Its definitely an excellent browser but I still prefer to use Firefox  Its just what Im used to now		
9390	Firefox has been my fav browser for years now  Chrome is giving it a run for money on the speed side	Facebook is a great tool for professional and personal contact management to keep up with people		
90191	like all these social networks there is a learning curve but Buzz shows great promise still test driving and trying to collapse the overly long threads!		
90194	It seamlessly works with the rest of my google stuff and the connections are savvy and helpful	Google analytics makes me look really smart  Which is quite an accomplishment		
90195	Simply the best social network	One of the most helpful tools i use		
34092	By far the best search engine	I like it  I like the ad ons  but Ill stick with chrome  its much faster		
10901	The best of the online feed readers  methinks		
2755	OMG TWITTER IS NUMBER ONE!		
1422	Def serves its purpose with regards to storage  Easy to use and manage  Good app overall	Great blog site   Huge fan	Possibly one of the coolest sites ever  So glad this thing exists  Just wish it could get shows online faster	Its novelty has worn off about 6 months ago  but it still serves a purpose  Good for networking and connecting w/ old friends	Serves its purpose  but dont use it enough  Not sure what the big deal is  Its just email	Really good source of information from the obscure to the current	Good  solid app  Fun and easy to use	Not for the weak of heart  but once you get it  you get it   Great application	One of the greatest creations since the pencil sharpener  Great to review pop culture stuff  Now if it would only add a comics section	Went from like to love   Great site  I want more		
1421	A beautiful way to display your book collection on the internet	I really wish I had more reason to use virb  The design interface is simply beautiful and elegant	The best source for all your web addiction needs	Best tool to stay connected on the internet and off the computer	combines the function of a blog with community extremely well  I love posting my own content as much as reading what others have to say	One of the best things to hit the web since Twitter  Blippr should be integrated with every site  :)

Probably not  but useful    especially when youre drunk and have to find this one song	Really? Does it need to be explained why Google is so great?	Good lord  this thing is consuming me	Gets a very bad rep  but works fine for many peoples basic browsing needs  The security holes do need to be fixed however	At last  a method of statistically proving my music taste is superior to your music taste	As much as I like its utility  I am also often furious at it for its shortcomings	The fact it is so often accurate is terrifying proof that we will soon all be killed by robots

8920	Just love it  I hardly ever did forward funny or interesting e mail to friends  I now forward my picks to my posterous	Twitter has become a commodity for some of us  Nevertheless  I think  should Facebook get better  it might be able to render twitter obsolete	I love GMail  But I think there is so much more that Google should do with mail  Google just is not cutting edge anymore

80907	Firefox blows goatz		
48854	Gmail revolutionised email	I resisted it for so long and now I wonder why	Love it  Much better than the iPhone	Its great  but its become so bloated in the past few versions that I tend to only use it now as a last resort  I dont need links  uploads  templates etc	Some way to go before its considered good    Its fast  but its CPU/memory footprint leaves a lot to be desired	Just brilliant  Unbeatable		
11591	First app Ive ever actually paid for   Love that it handles my multiple twitter accounts		
8941	Its really hit the mainstream media recently  I use it to find out and echo topics of interest to my professional life  Its been great so far

11595	It is an amazing step up from Tiger    The reference OS	Now if I could only keep up a blog for longer than two weeks	The hub of my digital life! The smart playlists  iTunes U and Podcast support makes this the go to app for all my listening related desires!	I wish I had photographed myself when realizing this wasnt just about the web apps    Books  games  movies  music    This is soooo awesome!	The browser of choice on my Mac  Despite everything  no other browser can match safari when Im on my home turf	This is my brain on super strong  knowledge increasing  free from all sideeffects except the addiction drugs  Any questions?	The best way to share pictures online! The groups dont work at all the way I would like them  but as a photo sharing site  pretty much unbeatable!	Not accessible enough  though    I never remember to go there  Good for killing a couple of hours  though!	Another all pervasive service  Too bad the social networking functions totally sucks	Getting a bit convoluted and bloated  it still is the reference app for any kind of graphics work more advanced than what Lightroom provides	The first webmail client I use over a desktop version  I miss a native iPhone app to be able to use tags in a more intuitive way  though	Keeping track of all my songs for new and interesting music recommendations  or listening to my library when I am away is real nice	I just dont read RSS like I used to    But if I were  google reader would be where I would be doing it!	The idea is great  Problem is  noone I know is using it  So for me  its just a comment system that works pretty much just like any other  Shame	Google might be king of search  but whenever I need movie info  this is the place to go	I tried to stay away for a long time    But I finally got it  Like the new facebook stream  only more alive!		
36872	Informative  A reliable source for the latest innovations and trends in social media		
15953	Its my media center of choice now  just wish it didnt crash so much !	Great people can buzz you on your mobile  without the app even being opened	Keeps my various web identities organized and just a click away  Support are very responsive also  Would love if Nimbuzz and Digsby partnered :)	More indispensable by the day  but they need to offer a client for S60 devices :( Nokia outsell the #2 and #3 cell phone makers combined FFS!	But the whole music thing is such a commodity  There are a zillion ways to be close to music  but the quality of music being put out leaves much to be desired :	But I havent devoted time to become adept with it		
44492	Best collection of high production and commercial video available free on the internet  but unfortunately most of it isnt viewable outside of the United State		
88875	Twitter is an objective proof that the world is flat  Few words  learning to get to the point

67964	Its a perfect sites for social networking  Having new interrelationship with different kinds of people		
12891	In my opinion the best Twitter client for iPhone	Really simple and a lot of choice to give your Twitter page your own look and feel	I chose Seesmic especially for its powerful multiple account management  Great tool!	I checked out a lot of blogging tools  but they just dont manage to catch up with the latest trends like WP  Besides the user interface is just great	Great  fast and easy tool		
8950	Coolest app after gmail! OK  lets sfeed some stuff now :)	Best app ever! :)

31174	i wish they would adopt some of chromes design (button positioning a lot better with chrome)	sorry!! chrome won me over		
80941	This is my first day but i love it already   Its quick and easy to use  WOOHOO at last lol		
31177	I use Chrome for regular browsing  but NO other browser comes close to the excellent extensions of FF!!!		
35530	I was using v 0 3 & that worked great! v0 4 (on 2 PCs) runs really slow! Cant seem to get it to work properly		
11561	Twitter is where you can talk to a crowd yet listen to select individuals based on who they are  who they listen to and what theyre talking about  @gelbendorf

83139	Until I get my own helicopter  Google Maps satellite view will do nicely	Very reliably tags songs and links to them in Amazons catalog  Really cool	For making elegant looking documents quickly and easily  iLife is the way to go  Its templates are such that you can make them your own with ease	Eerily good at picking out tracks and artists that I like  Love the statistics it provides  Scrobble me happy	Twitter in principle might be more interesting than Twitter in practice; plus whats with the 140 character limit ;)?	I prefer this to Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes  for instance  since I can see my friends ratings  Really like the Web 2 0 features of the site  too

85787	In less than 15 minutes  my mom knew how to (micro)blog! Thanks  Tumblr!	It was love @ 1st sight when it loaded my FB games effortlessly  Now I cant browse online without it! I love the speed and its omnibar!	As someone whos not comfy with face to face interactions  I loved how FB helped me break the ice among my colleagues by sharing snarks and jokes  :)	Name it  VLC plays it  Minor quibble: could use some pretty fying  interface wise		
13236	I like it  but dislike having to always qualify all my tasks with things like dates and locations  Needs the ability to be more simple	awesome for tweeting! Lives happily in the background without making me feel smothered with tweets  Icon could NOT be cuter!		
14564	It is teh shizzle  and allows for the best  most fast and functional AND cleanest interface  and is really easy to use  Without this  I wouldnt e mail so much

43099	I cant believe I didnt find this before  I dont know where I was when BJ Thomas was at the top of his game I guess they didnt show videos then like now		
9423	Use it for sharing sites with friends  not so much for tagging itself		
95134	Its ok  it needs to have a lot more content to be excellent though   I really appreciate the convenience  but what I want to watch is never on there	Who doesnt like YouTube?  Yeah  theres a lot of crap on it  and it can be glitchy  but if your subscribed to the right people  can be a good way to burn time	TweetDeck is AWESOME!  The iPhone/iPod version has some bugs and the Facebook connectivity needs some UI help but other than that    GREAT!	I <3 Gmail   Works well on every platform Ive used it  tons of room and lots of connectivity   Whats not to like?	Its ok  but all these light boxes are a bit annoying	Very nice  gets the job done when it comes to getting the word out   How fun it is also really depends on who you follow   Open APIs is excellent too

51566	Most useful Twitter app because it has so many options   searches  directory  customized columns and more  Only thing lacking: ability to schedule tweets	Wonderfully useful! I follow Mashable on Twitter and check the blog at least once a day for reviews  news and really helpful lists		
13202	Better than other Twitter apps Ive tried  but I havent really pushed it yet  Only 1 account and dont use the favorites feature	Easy to pull in various IM accounts and social networking tools  Runs a little slow  but simplifies my life		
48781	This is the application that will change my world		
38504	Its great  As simple or as complex as you want	Chromes become my default browser on my Windows machines  I love the minimalist design  I just wish theyd make Mac and Linux versions already		
10181	You can come out with new versions of all the other browsers  but unless you make it as extensible as Firefox  it wont make me switch		
63550	chat to people ill miss		
15872	It took a little bit to understand how to really use it  but Twitter is great with the right Twitter app		
64883	Its okay just is that today    its a little outdated

One of the best for planning your daily activities  Love it!	My favorite blog  it has to be included in my daily reads		
10182	If only I had come up with such a great idea	I dont use it anymore  but its okay  Not my favorite	Vimeo is the YouTube for respectful  creative  serious users  Love it	Best photo sharing site ever	Ive tried just about every desktop app for Twitter and this is by far my favorite	Hulu    interfering with my productivity since 2007	Its a shame that its being overrun with spam  Its making me like Craigslist less and less  but it still has a place in my heart		
71179	Gowalla is absolutely epic! It makes me happy dance

83145	As much as I like playing Mafia Wars  that pretty much sums it up  That was funny	Its a great IM client but it needs a light version so it doesnt consume CPU  Also  with some accounts  they then to have connection fails		
15873	I use the Tweetie application for my iPhone   quick  light and easy		
9428	Like Firefox but using Chrome 95% of the time now because its so much faster

It is so streamlined and lets me keep everything in one place  instead of a dozen!	With time  this could replace email  but it needs time to mature and have a developer community grow before it gains widespread adoption  Best for collaboration	Google Chrome is great! With a larger developer community and a better extension API  this could really take off  By far  one of the best web browsers around!	I like it  but I like the FriendFeed layout better   No ads  slick interface and better realtime  Facebooks good because so many people use it

I miss all Firefox extensions	Great way to see alternatives to applications you use day in and day out	New user here  I love the idea and websites interface  Good job!	Rediscovered Last fm again and this time I am not going away :)	Good email client  but I still prefer Gmail	I am still exploring it  but I like what I see	I used to love Opera  but their support for Ajaxy websites like Google docs  Google Reader made me switch to Firefox	Decent website  but their interface really needs a makeover	FIrefoxs greatest feature is its extensions  I do wish it was a little snappier and used a little less resources	I like it (specially the HD option)  but I am not an avid user	I wish they supported Opera and Google Chrome better	I like application and advertising  platforms	If you must go with Linux I guess Ubuntu is a good choice	Sometimes I find myself reading Wikipedia for hours	I like their programming section	I like their drag and drop support

81352	 I like it because its quick and easy to use		
30649	Fast  secure  free and simply works		
68375	I still prefer IE to the rest of the options		
90297	Its a great way to communicate with SHORT messages to a vast audience		
37260	hmm still waiting for an invite		
8165	I like how it uses less flash than pandora  It seems like it gives me more control  The user interface could use a few changes  though	The webmail interface is great  but I use my own email client (Evolution) since you can  Free IMAP support is awesome!	I still prefer Firefox  and Im waiting for Linux support  but its OK  Each tab and plug in as its own process is a great idea as processors get more cores	Overall  its probably the best browser available  I love how easy it is to add extensions  And it works great on Linux!

Dabbled with Opera (not bad) but keep coming back to the Fox  The add ons should only be used sparingly (I think)	Still my main feed reader! Not beautiful  But wonderfully practical  fast and configurable  Bloglines has not kept pace at all  Go GR	An essential tool for me  I actually understand what it does! Make sure you get the updates	Blippr! First time I have actually enjoyed posting anything on the internet  Thanks  Blippr people  Very Much

36091	It tends to clog up my machine but for some reason I prefer WLM over Pidgin and other free alternatives	Best webmail ever! Gmail beats the crap out of Hotmail  The Google guys keep tweaking it and add cool new features every so often	Although its contributors work their behinds off to improve it  its not quite there yet  For example: as long as Apple doesnt allow iPhone syncing  Im out	I like Search  I love Gmail  but privacy is an issue with Google  But then again  any internet company this size would have that problem	I like it  but you should take steps to safeguard your privacy

59639	love it  i need to go online at least for 5 min every day! lol

46312	Awesome  So very flexible! www hollywoodorblog com!

34335	I love You God    Gos is my Livee!!!		
85005	Fun to share great little status messages when youre on the go so you dont have to type out a huge status  Great for people who text  I reccomend it strongly	I love facebook  It keeps you in touch with all the friends that I cant see all of the time  and I can find people that I havent seen in years		
35664	~ time waster  but great for news and design information sharing		
33000	unlimited storage is nice if they dont hand over my privacy to the govment		
35663	Easy twitter updates from my iPhone   because whats Twitter if you cant tweet on the go?	Im not a huge flickr user  but its multiple photostreams have certainly proven useful as part of my wifes business  Also  easy mobile uploads	Google Voice takes typical Google awesomeness  mixes it with convenience  functionality and ease of use  and gives us a damn fine no holds barred app  Love it	Yahoo is like that old t shirt youve never thrown out  Its too ratty to wear  but it has sentimental value	As a die hard Hotmailer  I have really come to like Gmails layout and email thread feature  It helps me keep track of email threads without needless searching	Twitter is absolutely awesome  To date  the ultimate in social networking and information gathering  Needs some tweaking  but outstanding overall		
88998	Its the best thing to have happened to the web !		
88996	By far my favorite blogging platform  it has tons of features and is very customizable  Its also pretty good as a CMS too!	Nice idea and pretty well executed  But I personally do not like the feel of it  its also kind of cluttered	How could someone not love YouTube? It has its flaws  but its still great!	Havent used it very much  but from what Ive seen  it seems very stable and well made  As with any Google application	Just got started with Blippr  but so far Im really loving it!

10389	One of my top sources  if not the top source  for all things Web2 0  Awesome!!		
13416	I liked it more when I first started using it  but now it hangs more than IE does for me  Add ons are nice  but not at the cost of performance	I use it as a real time RSS feed for everything from local news to celebrities   all first hand accounts	Too easy to use! Didnt realize blogging could become so simple   Fast and effective  so far so good!	Its just okay in my opinion  but seems like it could present the aggregated feeds in a bit more of an attractive fashion	This app is working really well for me  very convenient  easy to use	I dont use Twitter enough to need this app  but it sure looks pretty		
13414	Im in/on board/happy/and learning  Meeting some very fine folks=D

65426	friendfeed is the best way to fine out wat some1s doing if they have alotta websites like me lol its easy to understand and great idea in general	i love facebook it connects to pretty much every other site i use and most of my friends use it :)	i love tht some1 came up with a review site like this	it makes twitter so much more enjoyable probably the best twitter app there is	its honestly the best place to find info about things	myspace really speaks for its self lol out of all the sites ive seen and been on it has the most customizable profile page	who doesnt love google?!! lol honestly if u go to google it loads faster than any other search engine

Decent chat client with support for lots of protocols (MSN  AOL  AIM  Gtalk  etc)  Good enough for basic chat  but could use more features though

32578	Perfection! I recently switched over from Windows & my stress level is down  plus I have stopped yelling at inanimate objects! It works and looks good doing it	Simple but useful  fun  and addicting!	Works a lot better than iChat & I like how it links my AIM and Yahoo accounts together  Very nice	Does what it needs to do  Its light  simple  and it works	I use this ALL the time! The #1 place to find anything you want to know about every movie ever	It used to be better & is now overcrowded with useless apps but a great way to keep in touch with friends and share photos	The best time waster ever created	So cool! I use it all the time and its nearly always right	Could use more full length movies but its excellent for catching up on missed TV shows	I only use it about 1000 times a day	Simply the best email in existence	Love love love it! Cool way to track my listening habits and it gives the best recommendations	The music store can be pretty slow but aside from that it works perfectly with my iphone and it keeps my music organized + Genius playlists are great	I know it isnt always right  but its the most convenient way to get a pretty good summary of any topic & can lead you to more reliable sources

Duh  of course I love it  Though sometimes I wish I didnt	I have recently started using Coda  and so far its excellent!	Solid platform  Robust  Can easily be used as a full fledged CMS  Easy to tweak to your will	I use iPhoto and iMovie ALL the time  Love it!	Love the entire suite!	I agree with vincentpjimenez that the only thing lacking from making this outstanding is the inability to view following/followers  But I bet it will soon!	Firefox is great  Versatile  Stable  And its not IE	Live and die by the Gmail  trying to convert the entire agency to it	Use it every day  Sometimes while driving  Must stop that	Basecamp is great  Live it everyday	Interesting  and oddly addictive	Could be better  Wish it didnt sap the processor so much  But where would we be without it  Its a big component of http://iMapWeather com

Interface is very usable and light  all round niceness	Liking the last 200 Tweets display  but wish there was a multiple accounts ooption  Easy to use and FREE!	First met the Shazam guys way back in something like 2001/2 prelaunch  exciting then  so much more so now  Love the iPhone app  Cant find a tune it doesnt get	Best feature is the multiple accounts option  Great GUI  I use in conjunction with TwitterFon for my main Twitter account as it displays the last 200 tweet	Getting more into Google Wave  But its fiddly  UI needs to be smoother  Makes a big difference testing with purpose  than testing for fun  Seems more stable	Enjoying using it  Less effort than Vista  Few issues with FF but ok now  Loving the Pin to Taskbar  Snip and having 3 world clocks (since Im travelling)

40934	great resource for startups		
40933	I love Google! I use it daily to surf around the internets	Google Chrome rocks! When Chrome is multiplatform  it shall rise and take over from every other browser!		
66706	I use Gmail several times a day  My favorite email client  especially powerful with an iPhone	I appreciate Twitter for its brevity; I long for better stream management capabilities in the web client  Looking forward to experimenting with lists		
40925	Best way I know to both contribute to and watch the conversations on the web		
50363	Tweetie on mac & iPhone   simples :)		
84598	Just one simple question What are you doing? and I am still answering that question with joy and fun		
76973	undeniably  one of the best blogs on social media! Im a daily reader!		
88954	I think you tube is hott!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!		
40929	TweetDeck rocks   Its flexible  customizable  helps you organize the tweets you follow  and it happens to be beautiful and cross platform		
76975	I just love Evernote its fantastic  Simple to use  work perfect in my Iphone   Eduardo Ovies		
8217	Superior to IE  Safari is still tops for Mac and I prefer Google Chrome for the PC  Firefox has fun Apps though		
8218	A great service that is very helpful when finding new apps to try!	A great way to blog!	Makes keeping track with friends and family as easy as logging on    and keeps out all that unwanted CSS that Myspace lets through! ;)	My favorite web browser  without a doubt  A bit over rated for its extensions  and not as fast as Opera  but I love it all the same	Absolutely  hands down  the greatest email service in existence  And its not even commercial (yet)!	My favorite when it comes to news    Digg is nice too  but nothing beats reddits community! ;)	Well the community could use some work  but when youre the most popular video service on the web youre bound to attract some kids  Great video sharing service	Would be my favorite messenger if not for its horrid memory usage  Good  but not great	After all these years  still the leader when it comes to finding what you want	The best way to keep track of my listening habits  Invaluable!	Love it for its social features  but still cant give up its older brother	The whole microblogging thing has gotten overblown; but this was the original service and inspired many great startups  Ingenuous idea  too!	Well I like Google and all    but the browser is in its infancy as of yet  When it matures a bit more  perhaps it will make me switch from Firefox!	Favorite torrenting application  supported by a wide variety of trackers  very fast and efficient    Invaluable for file sharing!		
54729	Definitely my favorite torrent program  Lightweight and stable!	Windows 7 = Like Vista  but better  Love the new taskbar!	An app I discovered moments ago  Im already hooked! This will certainly become one of my most frequently visited web sites!	I made the change to Gmail a few years ago  and havent looked back once  The interface  the amount of storage   its great!	Ubuntu gives me that warm  Im not a slave to big corporations feel every time it boots up  I like the interface  and its simplicity		
38614	very interesting and keeps u updated in real time		
48890	myspace is like da coolest web site like no one hates it in my whole life one preson has told me myspace was wack		
13336	Easiest and most flexible blog platform   bar none	Love my Android phone  could not love it any more unless it brought me breakfast in bed  And to iPhone fanboys I have one thing to say: concurrent processes		
15999	But Chrome is better  IMO	Fast  fast  fast  fast  fast  faaaaaast  I use it and I like it  When adds comes out  It will pwn Firefox so bad		
47559	Its almost like Google has a hand in every app I use these days  Email  browser  docs  maps  FBs not far behind  These guys want to rule the internets	Best browser Ive ever used  bar none  The add ons and customization are what make Firefox extremely powerful and useful	Eloquence in 140 characters  lots of noise too  you just need to have a little care with the people you choose to follow back		
73009	Still the best news source for web2 0 news	I really like Google Readers simplicity   just wish there was a better mobile version		
73006	*sigh* i cant believe imeem is gone   i had so many favorite playlists		
10270	Evernote is amazing and the free edition is a steal! It can be a light CRM  a brain dump  a GTD tool  a project document collection and much more		
48885	Its kool but sumXs u get bored:=]]		
8236	The most usefull social network		
62356	prolly zi best    but big and scary		
75663	i like and new come to join Twitter		
66719	but I have always problems with updates (themes and plugins stop working)  Is this an eternal BETA process? WTH!		
22250	Testing out Blippr   hope this works	Its making my life a lot easier		
87656	a better tool than twitter	Greatest blog on the net!		
34244	After of 32 000 rankings of over 3 000 titles I am still addicted  Damn I love this site		
88987	pretty nice stuff  great community  Google Picasa is way better	If youre in it  you wont want out	Probably the best mobile operating system in the world  Using an iPhone though	my first twitter client  needsupdates!	lot of potential  lot of lag  lot of not everyone uses it so i wont too	best browser on the market so far  megafast  newest html4 technology in it  Flash Support  comes right with windows :) ROFLMAO just kiddin	by far the best E Mail Service		
15964	I really love it  When i have some issue  They always give me good solution		
10277	Until 2 days ago I used it without question  Now  after a load of crashes  Im looking elsewhere	Its what Im using now  but theres definitely some awkward niggly issues that need ironing out before I commit to it		
43196	Gmail has changed the worled arounf  remember the days when yahoo was giving just 5 mb http://www umeedastrology com		
10276	a true cool and incredibly usefull application  especially if u use a PC next to your MB	ideal to share docs between multiple pc/macs and users		
88983	Tiger Woods ve http://organizebrnckvvtmllttrhaberi blogspot com/ birarada		
14636	Easy to use  Great for posting links to media and stealing stuff off others  See my own page  for instance  (Cool layout   but nicked from someone else)		
38605	I really like firefox  it works really well  has a ton of cool apps like firebug and is really customizable		
10280	I adore Last fm  I really do  Now  if I could figure out a way to get it to scrobble songs from Pandora  Id be set	It can be extremely useful  but I honestly dont use it very much  I wish it were used on more sites	I use TweetDeck for my main account  but I still swear by Twhirl for the ability to access more than one Twitter account at once  (Plus Seesmic!)	Used to love it  but with all the changes  Im liking it less and less	I dont use it as much as I use FF  but I havent ever had any major problems with it	Its easy to use  and works with Last fm	Of all the photo sites I use  Flickr is by far my favorite	Microblogging in video form! I dont use it as often as Id like  because the lighting in here isnt that great at night  and I dont have a camera when Im out	I was on this site a lot before  but I dont remember why I stopped  (Changed computers  maybe?) It was fun to use and interesting  Try it yourself!	Ive been on a lot of blogging platforms for the long term  and tried even more  Xanga is different because it rocks the community aspect more than the others	TweetDeck is awesome  Its the application I go to for my main Twitter account  I had to use something else for two days and realized how much I depend on it	Probably the biggest site for videos  but its becoming harder and harder to find videos that havent been taken down for one reason or another	Well  if I didnt like it  I wouldnt be here  right?		
63693	hi             friend i am umesh chandra rao

96596	Ive used Mashable for Social Media research and it is INVALUABLE!		
34230	Voting on movies is a no brainer  Already addicted and struggle to pull myself away  Cant imagine when the site is enhanced and more movies are added		
26626	Web 2 0 is still a vast tundra of possibilities in so many ways and while we are all still figuring it out  Mashable is happily our personal Tenzing Norgay	I used to love it  until all the send me this and super throw that started  Now it just seems like more games and ads than anything else	I dont dislike it  but it might just be my user ignorance in that its basically just another app that overlaps  You just pick your fave to use	Simple  to the point  put your ideas out there and listen to others  If you have good content  people follow you  Simple  until @oprah showed up that is		
87649	Lots of good features		
39929	It keep life going and running

93438	please invite me (amanda orangejeruk@gmail com) thanks   :)

Extremely useful  I always find myself checking up on actors and films  Great resource	Be smart about how you use it and its an awesome resource  Great place to get some quick info		
15144	Spotify is awesome  Seriously  Free  easy to access  legal music  You have no excuse not to get it   Well  unless its unavailable in your country	Great browser  The add ons are nice  however it takes up a load of memory		
93436	cool image search!!		
15143	Just started using Blippr quite like it		
70792	I dont know  I have mixed feelings about Twitter  Its fun and stuff  but I dont like the hype around it	I wanted to see if it could live up the hype so I checked it out right away  I must say  it looks promising so far		
59520	HEY GUYZ IM NEW HERE

48062	Been using Firefox for about four years  Love it and the competition its encouraged in the browser world	Its pretty good  Paving the way for more TV to end up on the Internet where it belongs  =)	Fun for playing with photos		
30788	Love that columns sync between this & desktop over air; wish sync kept track of whats been read though  Anyone figure out a way to do this?		
67158	No black background! It comes on too hard  Seesmic is mild and nice

93425	hope it wont become a bluff	one of the greatest concepts evr		
73830	the best application ive ever seen !		
55171	Very useful tool both for computer and mobile use		
76093	Best alternative to Photoshop	Great interface  Great functionality		
36075	Awesome way to find new artists  Just a shame the play on demand isnt as simple and comprehensive as spotify	Like we have a choice ; ) On OS X Safari looks great but historically security is sketchy  using Internet Explorer is asking to get hacked  Opera lacks addons		
8262	Like YouTube    but without the 12 year old girl lip syncing Justin Timberlake  Instead  think artists  film makers  and just plain cool people		
9594	I love watching TED with this	the new feature supporting local content is wild		
90391	  Simple chat nice		
76096	It is very light and very efficient  Do not hog CPU resources	It is the best webmail i ever used  No doubt that it is easy to customize and user friendly  GUI is very easy to use even for those are not computer savvy

81441	I love the new software stack  and it feels more real worldly   finally a MS OS I can sink my teeth into!	Internet Explorer has come a long way and since MS continues to dominate the OS market  its something we need to keep in mind  Not such a necessary evil anymor		
29797	i like <a title=youtube izlesene video izle  videolar href=http://www youtubetc com/>youtube</a> very much		
59534	yeah man   this is good stuff  like eating a phillty steak sandwich mmmmmmmmm good

42740	So far the best twitter app	Best music app ever		
92125	I have to find out  This is the first time I see it  So   still unclear www flamingoservicesbonaire colm		
41411	Dont know the reason but I love using this OS		
37397	Cant pass a day without checking it and sometimes spend hours		
37399	Its good for keeping up to date with close friends  Bad because you get bombarded by stupid applications and people you dont like		
36066	CS 3 ist perfect for designing websites but CS 4 sucks badly! The problem ist that CS 4 does not render the fonts like they will be shown in the browsers! FAIL!		
36065	Glitches with GCal oddly enough and other random bugs  Lacks extensions and bookmark syncing    still use it as default for overall speed  may switch to FF 3 5		
92121	oh my fecking god  best thing ever  i am truely addicted  :)		
42746	Aside from the Orwellian overtones and my inability to ignore the similarities between Google and The Borg  of course   I love Google		
55183	I think its funny that we are allowed 160 characters in this field instead of  140 like  twitter  allows : ) Im kidding  Love twitter!		
41416	When will be available on Facebook  or am I not up to date with this bit of news?		
49370	facebook is amazing and i love it sooo i have a question does anyone know a proxy site???		
30760	Created a group  could not add people  nor could I delete the group  Potential is there  not ready for release		
55187	The newest kid on the block  Rockstar	Couldnt imagine using another Webmail  Have been using it for five years now  still love it as much as I did when I started using it   if not more  Go Gmail!	Used to be my browser of choice  not anymore  On Chrome since it came out	I like orkut a tad better  if only because all my relatives & old friends are there	The fastest  slickest browser to date		
30762	Love the UI  Very clever way to display multiple panels of content   Excellent work TD Team!		
1631	Easily the best webmail Ive ever used  Spam filter has let 2 pieces of spam through in 5 years of use  More storage than Ive ever needed  Perfect	Great  Maybe Chrome is better but at the moment it doesnt offer me anything worth the hassle of getting used to soemthing new		
36069	A good social network unfortunately being abused for spam and irritating apps  Still one of the best ways to share any kind of media you like	Mozilla based  fast  functional with the best built in RSS reader Ive seen so far  Very well integrated social networking and media browsing	Although Im a Firefox user  I like to use Chrome a lot  It really is the fastest browser Ive seen  Its very lightweight and it never gets in your way	Google is the heart of the internet	I wish they didnt do the native look for Windows  I used to use Safari specifically to escape Windows  and now it just looks like a native application  Shame	Incredibly powerful & useful social networking tool with minimal interface  Trending topics is one of the best ways online to be up to date with news worldwide		
48045	 a cool was to show case video		
30765	Hopelessly addicted  First thing I do in the morning  Its my newspaper!	I would love it if I could update facebook at the same time  I thought that was one of the features		
48041	Very fast  Easy interface  Still misses the plugins of FireFox  but a great browser!	Very good site  Lots of news about social media  High refresh rate		
30766	* Crashed twice * Told me I wasnt connect to internet  I was * Like the UI * Limits refreshes to 100/hr?! Likely wont hit that but if I do Id drop it		
94776	I LIKE IT ! ITS FUN TO HAVE ! :)

16461	a ridiculous idea doing fine an a crazy world   i would prefer going out for a beer with my meat and bone friends but what to do?? by the way  i tweet too		
8287	Love it on the PS3! Only have 1 dvd out at a time but its totally worth it!		
15135	i dont have the opportunity to have it but i really thing is very cool	really useful application  i work for all my projects from any computer		
93449	cant not love it    useful    the forum software by the same company is also great: bbpress		
92117	The 10 50 works with most sites  but some of my bookmarklets stopped working		
2980	Will be the perfect tool when people will start using it massively  But the concept is so good  Simple is everything	Their recommendation system is so useful and it runs very smoothly

58229	I love GMail  So Fast and reliable  And much less clutter than Yahoo or Hotmail	Amazing browser  Stop using IE  IE so clunky and so  compare it to the speed and extensions of Firefox!		
1643	Great service that has allowed me to re connect with old friends and keep up with everyones lives  Sharing photos and links and stories   its a great site!	Great browser! Always my first choice  While 3 5 has fixed a lot of the memory leak issues  they still remain  Still a top notch browser	Good gaming platform that likely demonstrates the future of digital distribution gaming		
30751	Love the interface  Not very stable (crashed 4 time already)  More customization would be nice (bg color  refresh rate)  Good so far  wanting updates soon		
29773	FF iz so damn goooooood!! iloveit!		
48035	Fast and fast is what I want  Wish it could integrate with One Note

30759	Really digging new #Tweetdeck for iPhone/iPod touch  lots of features  Loving the layout		
30756	Its tiny a little hard to read  I first thought I could enlarge columns  Not bad though its useful to perhaps check all my groups quickly  Im mixed		
48030	If speed is your thing   its mine   Chrome is the best	Mashable is an integral part of my daily news feed		
30755	Looks cool and works ok  Crashed once already  not on App Store WiFi yet  Go to desktop Itunes @nonprofitadvice		
8297	I like it  though it does have an odd look	Whatd I do before I had my iPhone? No clue  because now an ordinary phone seems like nothing in comparison  I so love my iPhone and couldnt live without it	You can listen all you want and discover new musical artists/bands and I just love that	Make lists of your fave movies  TV shows  fave actors/actresses  musical artist     Theres everything to love about that	How can anyone not love Wikipedia? It really is an endless source of knowledge to all things	Best way to find and discover new websites  Of any given kind  because you can  pretty much  modify it for your own liking	I always have Twitter on the go  when out and needs the Twitter world to know what Im doing  Rarely  but I can do it	Im trying this after TweetDeck and Twhirl is definitely better all around  Twhirls much more accesible than TweetDeck will ever get

8291	Cleaner than MySpace  All of the options and services and such are a bit daunting  Learning the ins and outs is difficult  considering the help is lackluster	Web surfing bliss  Scads of add ons for nearly every purpose  Clean  organized and easy to use  Blows every other browser out of the water		
58231	The more you tweet  the more you want to  Its additive

61884	Khub Bhalo(1st class)		
79176	Useful and fast to look things up  but not always reliable	Its useful and has many options  but its not customizable  so I prefer Myspace	Its so cool you can see other people form around the world  but there is so many hateful people being rude	Able to personalize it  has many options  and great add ons! Love it!

67364	If you use torrents  and havent tried uTorrent  you are missing out   By far the best client out there!	A great tool for cleaning up your PC   I cleared over a gig with one use!  (Do NOT use on netbooks! It wiped mine out and I had to reimage it!)  Great for PCs!	A great tool for any type of social networking!  Enter any URL and bit ly shrinks it down to a smaler URL   Great for Twitter or to refrain from FB clutter!	Twitter is an amazing social network that allows you to express big ideas in small status updates	Tired of constant viruses and popups?  Ditch IE  and go with Firefox!  Better browsing  and safer surfing!	Theres precious little that you cannot find on this user created encyclopedia!	This is a great desktop app that allows quick access to your Twitter timeline  as well as providing a fast way to respond	Travel the world while in your pajamas!  Great satellite images combined with 3D models!	A must bookmark site for those who are into social networking and news on all things electronic media

Stable  nice interface  enough options  lots of network support	My new telephone number =)  Free SMS  voicemail handling  voicemail transcripts  record calls  integrates with Google contacts from Gmail  rings multiple phones	Great core marketplace  always competitive prices  very wide selection   Other vendors are exposed here as well  so the selection is vast   Prime rocks	Picasa does photo management right   Facial recognition  upload to the web  Facebook integration  a nice slideshow and standlone viewe  crossplatform!		
59746	Use it every day! Didnt take long for me to upgrade  Connected to 4 computers already!!

33957	So far good  just getting used to using it  Added to email contacts & can send notes via Twitter 2  Just have to remember to check it now & then   Worth a try	I use yelp ALL the time 2 find restaurants or to decide what Im in the mood 4  The reviews have been very helpful & it even gives phone # & directions	So far Im loving blippr but more of my friends need to join AND they need an iPhone app!		
32626	This is quite interesting  For freelance designers	Wow! This will really revolutionize how we communicate through various mediums ranging from emails to blogs  Cant wait!		
88296	There is not a leaderboard for most rated or most viewed videos    but its still great!	Lovely blog  a lot of up to date information and all very useful  Id like to have it in Italian  but its perfect anyway

42896	Been using it since alpha stage amazing its really developed with plug ins and added functionality	Like quicksilver  great for all your app needs :) works really well	good but like most of googles things its over hyped and i think wont be of use to a mass market	Google is good but in its mobile version it formats EVERYTHING when i have a webkit browser even after trying to turn it off	Great idea! but wish the site would be more mobile friendly and work on more browsers by displaying correctly	really good way of displaying info and really like the 3d effects thou its fun not useful to me

2159	The best website to check if you need information about a movie or TV show (or want to know what other fans are saying/theorizing about them)	Overall  it is very good  better than IE  but ties up too much memory  Has its share of issues with Vista  both 32 and 64 bit

30073	Great tool! I learned and communicated a ton with it		
30072	Twitter is a really great micro blogging site  They need to catch up to some of the 3rd party developers though  The Twitter homepage is almost obsolete		
33105	I just started using Twitter a few weeks ago and Im hooked  my emails are piling up  my website remains unfinished  maybe I should change the theme to Twitter!

91850	llong time not used  but easy and reliable		
43373	its a good site to be look for it		
69921	I have it but rarely use it  but it is handy for the odd occasion I need it  For the rest of the time I have a text editor or wordpad	Not sure I will ever be able to fall in love with a social networking application  but Facebook is certainly the most popular  why? My space to messy?	I only wish they could get a higher reliability but for what it costs it is one of the best applications out there  Could be better but doesnt have to be	I have 7 Vista XP and Leopard running on my machines  Whilst 7 is better than Vista to say it is better than XP on stability is odd  still big driver glitches	It is so buggy at the moment and as slow as a zx81 running quake  I want to like it but it has a long way to go yet  and it needs more users to be useful	Favourite default browser shame it isnt on Mac yet  t lack ad ons which is a shame for the ads etc  But it is so fast it makes FF look asleep	A very straight forward interface that requires only one key to use the J  Actually the keyboard short cuts are Google standard so easy to remember  Great!	Tried many CMSs over the year but this beauty does everything I need and does it well  clean simple interface elegant stylish just use it! 8 sites using it	Not as hot on it as I was a year ago  Took the premium due to the upload limit  but never used it  Pro lapsed wont be renewing it  Something needs sorting out	Would have chosen love it which I did even have the premium  But there have been some glitches in the stream and artists like Dylan removed from catalog	Useful for when the other parts of the web fail such as email major sites etc  keep up to date with stuff including tv shows	Hard to fault it as a client this is near perfect extremely small foot print only wish other coders would learn from this		
90522	likes to talk to de brods		
69928	at the moment we cant use facebook in my country Vietnam		
30068	Twitter is a statistical sample of the worlds brain & thus how we think   dont be a geek on Twitter and say statistical sample; people wont like you! :)		
30067	Twitter is great!  I was to be a Twenius!		
52250	Just a sharp enough learning curve to keep out some idiots   But accessible enough for an idiot like me		
57943	so far its ohk it aint that bad i gess wat eva just get use 2 it lol		
30069	Great example of good  relevant blogging	Its growth will bring eventual dilution of relevance  Will be around forever  but will someday be just that thing you used to do		
30064	Best App For Torrent Dloading		
77554	Safari is the best browser!		
30063	My favourite Twitter app  makes my life easier and less chaotic :D	Twitters fab! It lets me connect to my friends  stay up to date on news and media that interest me and follow my favourite celebs  artists  authors & more!		
77556	Took me a while to figure out what scrobbling is  but I like the idea	Really slick looking native Twitter app for the Mac	Useful backup for when Quicktime doesnt cut it on a mac  Doesnt have the same sort of integration  though	Boring but functional interface  Loads of storage  but doesnt always play nice with clients because of its use of labels instead of folders	Amazing  Simply Amazing	Anytime I dont think I like OS X  I think of Windows and shutter		
34420	Hey Im Linux guy		
35751	makes the world feel smaller

57949	muahhhhh sayang zaha		
78889	ahhh   kok gw yg kena marah cih		
10450	I like the idea of it how I can email  chat and tweet all in one window  but it feels 80% done and needs better privacy		
89534	Really like the integration with Google Reader  And since its Google  future APIs might actually work (as opposed to certain other social media APIs)		
11786	It works better with Iphones	One of the best Search Engine	Google is the best of the best search engine	The best email app	Very useful SEO friendly browser  which supports almost all addons related to SEO work  I am a big fan of it	Very improved Book marking site	I love it cos Very easy to share our thoughts and liked web pages	Any body can try it  effective feed reader

34413	I love Firefox  Its my home browser		
29077	Its getting betterer and betterer all the time		
34412	Prefer this over Flickr any day :D gives a huge sense of community	Chrome is better for me  but if you want reliability  compatibility  standards compliant  and highly customizable  Firefox is the best choice	Simple  lightweight  super fast  Only thing it needs is Greasemonkey  built in  (i know theres a hack for it  but hey )	Works great  Good for publicity for blogs  great for discovering new things  way easier than news sites	Its constantly open  I use it every day  great for designing  art  doodling  and the new screen sharing tool is amazing		
35743	I also love it for its flexability to access my mail from anywhere and archive everything		
78872	The best torrent app	Some think Google Buzz could be the next huge social platform		
89529	i love it itz coolll		
78875	Skitch is great  It only sucks that the UI prevents me from saving an image that is higher than my screen  (The sharing tab is not available then )		
31383	Wordpress is the best CMS Ive ever used!	I love Digg! Its so easy to keep track of my favorite sites   without pissing around with my bookmarks! I also like finding new sites with Digg :D

10438	its great for quick facts    not so great for academic research	i love it  but i really miss all the firefox add ons that simplify my life	i liked it more at first    i miss the simple interface & college only network (much more useful to find people in classes  etc)	i like the email and the ability to hide your real name from public profiles

Something between blogger and twitter  Just what I always wanted and needed!	Definitely the best social networking news site  Learned and discovered a lot of things from it	Tried every IM and this one suits me the most  Connects to all networks including major social networks and email  Missing some features but nothing crucial	I was trying to get into Twitter for a while until I figured all the available applications and iPhone apps  Since then  everything made more sense	Simple  effective and gorgeous  What else would you want?	Being a Flash developer  I have nothing bad to say about it  :) Too processor intensive  Thats it  Really	This is awesome  We can finally see the week (or a single day) in pictures from everyday people with ease	Exactly like Xbox Live but for PC  Buying a game is only a couple of clicks away  Pricey games in Europe due to 1 euro = 1 dollar conversion though	I use it for a long  long time now and I simply cannot switch to anything else  Extensions and Greasemonkey scripts are an irreplaceable combination
